platform for sharing their love of board games. Once a user creates a profile,
board game titles can be added to the user's library. The user can comment and
vote on other board game titles, giving other users valuable insight into a
specific board game. Users can also share their board game library with others
by adding users to their profile as friends. With Board Game Tracker, you
