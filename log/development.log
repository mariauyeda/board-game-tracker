The ashes from the first great war still darken the snow. The capitalistic city-state known simply as &ldquo;The Factory&rdquo;, which fueled the war with heavily armored mechs, has closed its doors, drawing the attention of several nearby countries.&#10;&#10;Scythe is a 4X board game set in an alternate-history 1920s period. It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player represents a character from one of five factions of Eastern Europa who are attempting to earn their fortune and claim their faction's stake in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.&#10;&#10;Each player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction&rsquo;s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place).&#10;&#10;Scythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player&rsquo;s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &ldquo;encounter&rdquo; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.&#10;&#10;Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.&#10;&#10;Every part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.&#10;&#10;\", \"yearpublished\"=>{\"value\"=>\"2016\"}, \"minplayers\"=>{\"value\"=>\"1\"}, \"maxplayers\"=>{\"value\"=>\"5\"}, \"poll\"=>[{\"results\"=>[{\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"11\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"46\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"15\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"1\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"4\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"70\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"19\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"2\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"30\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"60\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"4\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"3\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"56\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"38\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"2\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"4\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"30\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"54\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"9\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"5\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"1\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"2\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"47\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"5+\"}], \"name\"=>\"suggested_numplayers\", \"title\"=>\"User Suggested Number of Players\", \"totalvotes\"=>\"120\"}, {\"results\"=>{\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"2\", \"numvotes\"=>\"1\"}, {\"value\"=>\"3\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"4\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"5\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"6\", \"numvotes\"=>\"1\"}, {\"value\"=>\"8\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"10\", \"numvotes\"=>\"8\"}, {\"value\"=>\"12\", \"numvotes\"=>\"15\"}, {\"value\"=>\"14\", \"numvotes\"=>\"4\"}, {\"value\"=>\"16\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"18\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"21 and up\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}]}, \"name\"=>\"suggested_playerage\", \"title\"=>\"User Suggested Player Age\", \"totalvotes\"=>\"29\"}, {\"results\"=>{\"result\"=>[{\"level\"=>\"1\", \"value\"=>\"No necessary in-game text\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"level\"=>\"2\", \"value\"=>\"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet\", \"numvotes\"=>\"2\"}, {\"level\"=>\"3\", \"value\"=>\"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups\", \"numvotes\"=>\"5\"}, {\"level\"=>\"4\", \"value\"=>\"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"level\"=>\"5\", \"value\"=>\"Unplayable in another language\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}]}, \"name\"=>\"language_dependence\", \"title\"=>\"Language Dependence\", \"totalvotes\"=>\"7\"}], \"playingtime\"=>{\"value\"=>\"115\"}, \"minplaytime\"=>{\"value\"=>\"90\"}, \"maxplaytime\"=>{\"value\"=>\"115\"}, \"minage\"=>{\"value\"=>\"14\"}, \"link\"=>[{\"type\"=>\"boardgamecategory\", \"id\"=>\"1021\", \"value\"=>\"Economic\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamecategory\", \"id\"=>\"1013\", \"value\"=>\"Farming\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamecategory\", \"id\"=>\"1046\", \"value\"=>\"Fighting\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamecategory\", \"id\"=>\"1086\", \"value\"=>\"Territory Building\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamemechanic\", \"id\"=>\"2080\", \"value\"=>\"Area Control / Area Influence\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamemechanic\", \"id\"=>\"2046\", \"value\"=>\"Area Movement\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamemechanic\", \"id\"=>\"2015\", \"value\"=>\"Variable Player Powers\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamefamily\", \"id\"=>\"26464\", \"value\"=>\"Alternate History\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamefamily\", \"id\"=>\"8374\", \"value\"=>\"Crowdfunding: Kickstarter\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamefamily\", \"id\"=>\"5666\", \"value\"=>\"Solitaire Games\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgameexpansion\", \"id\"=>\"205121\", \"value\"=>\"Scythe: Encounter Promo Pack #2\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgameexpansion\", \"id\"=>\"199727\", \"value\"=>\"Scythe: Invaders from Afar\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgameexpansion\", \"id\"=>\"204984\", \"value\"=>\"Scythe: Lake Encounter Card\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamedesigner\", \"id\"=>\"62640\", \"value\"=>\"Jamey Stegmaier\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgameartist\", \"id\"=>\"33148\", \"value\"=>\"Jakub Rozalski\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamepublisher\", \"id\"=>\"4785\", \"value\"=>\"Ghenos Games\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamepublisher\", \"id\"=>\"30677\", \"value\"=>\"Maldito Games\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamepublisher\", \"id\"=>\"28323\", \"value\"=>\"Morning\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamepublisher\", \"id\"=>\"23202\", \"value\"=>\"Stonemaier Games\"}], \"marketplacelistings\"=>{\"listing\"=>[{\"listdate\"=>{\"value\"=>\"Wed, 06 Jul 2016 06:54:15 +0000\"}, \"price\"=>{\"currency\"=>\"USD\", \"value\"=>\"199.00\"}, \"condition\"=>{\"value\"=>\"new\"}, \"notes\"=>{\"value\"=>\"Available now!

Now, the great factions of the galaxy mobilize their fleets and race to establish a foothold. The reward for successful domination surpasses all other concerns, and the price for conquering this sector will be paid in lives.&#10;&#10;Forbidden Stars challenges you and up to three other players to take command of a mighty fighting force: the Ultramarines chapter of Space Marines, the Eldar of Craftworld Iyanden, the Evil Sunz Ork clan, or the World Eaters Warband of the Chaos Space Marines. Each faction offers unique armies and play styles, but your goal remains the same &ndash; to claim the key objectives selected for your faction. These objective tokens are scattered throughout the Herakon Cluster, but your opponents are sure to defend your objectives against you. You need to build massive armies and command them in unending war to best your enemies and claim your objectives. The fight for the Herakon Cluster is brutal and bloody, and you will either stride triumphant over the bodies of your fallen foes, or they will do the same to you.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;Each round in Forbidden Stars is divided into three phases.  In the Planning Phase, players will take turns placing order tokens face down on the separate tiles (systems) that make up the game board.  The four types of order tokens that players may place during the Planning Phase correspond to four types of actions that players can resolve in the second phase of play, Operations.  In the Operations Phase, players can reveal a Dominate token to drain friendly planets of their important resources, a Strategize token to purchase cards which can upgrade their orders and combat abilities, a Deploy order which allows them to build cities, factories, bastions, and new mobile units, or an Advance order to move units and attack their enemies.  The last phase of each round is the Refresh Phase, where players profit off of the planets they control, reveal event cards to move the impassable Warp Storms, and heal any units that were wounded in battle.&#10;&#10;Because of the game's three-phase structure, strategy in Forbidden Stars is balanced between short-term bluffing and long-term tactical military action.  The game's setup also poses strategic opportunities.  Players start the game by taking turns assembling sections of the Herakon Cluster, placing individual system tiles along with their own starting forces and the enemy objectives which they must defend.  This intentional construction, along with the unique Domination abilities of the game's four factions, means that Forbidden Stars will see players working to best utilize their own force's strengths while exploiting the weaknesses of their opponents.&#10;&#10;\", \"yearpublished\"=>{\"value\"=>\"2015\"}, \"minplayers\"=>{\"value\"=>\"2\"}, \"maxplayers\"=>{\"value\"=>\"4\"}, \"poll\"=>[{\"results\"=>[{\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"1\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"4\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"73\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"1\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"55\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"51\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"8\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"2\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"56\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"50\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"7\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"3\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"39\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"46\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"24\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"4\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"60\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"4+\"}], \"name\"=>\"suggested_numplayers\", \"title\"=>\"User Suggested Number of Players\", \"totalvotes\"=>\"138\"}, {\"results\"=>{\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"2\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"3\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"4\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"5\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"6\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"8\", \"numvotes\"=>\"1\"}, {\"value\"=>\"10\", \"numvotes\"=>\"4\"}, {\"value\"=>\"12\", \"numvotes\"=>\"9\"}, {\"value\"=>\"14\", \"numvotes\"=>\"17\"}, {\"value\"=>\"16\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"18\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"21 and up\", \"numvotes\"=>\"2\"}]}, \"name\"=>\"suggested_playerage\", \"title\"=>\"User Suggested Player Age\", \"totalvotes\"=>\"33\"}, {\"results\"=>{\"result\"=>[{\"level\"=>\"1\", \"value\"=>\"No necessary in-game text\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"level\"=>\"2\", \"value\"=>\"Some necessary text -

Blurring the traditional lines between roleplaying and card game experiences, Arkham Horror: The Card Game is a Living Card Game of Lovecraftian mystery, monsters, and madness!&#10;&#10;In the game, you and your friend (or up to three friends with two Core Sets) become characters within the quiet New England town of Arkham. You have your talents, sure, but you also have your flaws. Perhaps you've dabbled a little too much in the writings of the Necronomicon, and its words continue to haunt you. Perhaps you feel compelled to cover up any signs of otherworldly evils, hampering your own investigations in order to protect the quiet confidence of the greater population. Perhaps you'll be scarred by your encounters with a ghoulish cult.&#10;&#10;No matter what compels you, no matter what haunts you, you'll find both your strengths and weaknesses reflected in your custom deck of cards, and these cards will be your resources as you work with your friends to unravel the world's most terrifying mysteries.&#10;&#10;Each of your adventures in Arkham Horror LCG carries you deeper into mystery. You'll find cultists and foul rituals. You'll find haunted houses and strange creatures. And you may find signs of the Ancient Ones straining against the barriers to our world...&#10;&#10;The basic mode of play in Arkham LCG is not the adventure, but the campaign. You might be scarred by your adventures, your sanity may be strained, and you may alter Arkham's landscape, burning buildings to the ground. All your choices and actions have consequences that reach far beyond the immediate resolution of the scenario at hand &mdash; and your actions may earn you valuable experience with which you can better prepare yourself for the adventures that still lie before you.&#10;&#10;\", \"yearpublished\"=>{\"value\"=>\"2016\"}, \"minplayers\"=>{\"value\"=>\"1\"}, \"maxplayers\"=>{\"value\"=>\"4\"}, \"poll\"=>[{\"results\"=>[{\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"1\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"2\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"3\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"4\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"4+\"}], \"name\"=>\"suggested_numplayers\", \"title\"=>\"User Suggested Number of Players\", \"totalvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"results\"=>{\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"2\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"3\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"4\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"5\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"6\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"8\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"10\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"12\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"14\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"16\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"18\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"21 and up\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}]}, \"name\"=>\"suggested_playerage\", \"title\"=>\"User Suggested Player Age\", \"totalvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"results\"=>{\"result\"=>[{\"level\"=>\"1\", \"value\"=>\"No necessary in-game text\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"level\"=>\"2\", \"value\"=>\"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"level\"=>\"3\", \"value\"=>\"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"level\"=>\"4\", \"value\"=>\"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable\", \"numvotes\"=>\"1\"}, {\"level\"=>\"5\", \"value\"=>\"Unplayable in another language\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}]}, \"name\"=>\"language_dependence\", \"title\"=>\"Language Dependence\", \"totalvotes\"=>\"1\"}], \"playingtime\"=>{\"value\"=>\"120\"}, \"minplaytime\"=>{\"value\"=>\"60\"}, \"maxplaytime\"=>{\"value\"=>\"120\"}, \"minage\"=>{\"value\"=>\"14\"}, \"link\"=>[{\"type\"=>\"boardgamecategory\", \"id\"=>\"1002\", \"value\"=>\"Card Game\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamecategory\", \"id\"=>\"1010\", \"value\"=>\"Fantasy\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamecategory\", \"id\"=>\"1024\", \"value\"=>\"Horror\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamecategory\", \"id\"=>\"1093\", \"value\"=>\"Novel-based\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamemechanic\", \"id\"=>\"2023\", \"value\"=>\"Co-operative Play\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamemechanic\", \"id\"=>\"2040\", \"value\"=>\"Hand Management\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamemechanic\", \"id\"=>\"2015\", \"value\"=>\"Variable Player Powers\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamefamily\", \"id\"=>\"4311\", \"value\"=>\"Arkham Horror\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamefamily\", \"id\"=>\"24281\", \"value\"=>\"Campaign Games\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamefamily\", \"id\"=>\"5141\", \"value\"=>\"Cthulhu Mythos\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamefamily\", \"id\"=>\"5337\", \"value\"=>\"Living Card Game\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamefamily\", \"id\"=>\"5666\", \"value\"=>\"Solitaire Games\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgameexpansion\", \"id\"=>\"208545\", \"value\"=>\"Arkham Horror: The Card Game – The Dunwich Legacy\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamedesigner\", \"id\"=>\"11655\", \"value\"=>\"Nate French\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamedesigner\", \"id\"=>\"40573\", \"value\"=>\"Matthew Newman\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamepublisher\", \"id\"=>\"15889\", \"value\"=>\"Asterion Press\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamepublisher\", \"id\"=>\"2973\", \"value\"=>\"Edge Entertainment\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamepublisher\", \"id\"=>\"17\", \"value\"=>\"Fantasy Flight Games\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamepublisher\", \"id\"=>\"4617\", \"value\"=>\"Galakta\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamepublisher\", \"id\"=>\"264\", \"value\"=>\"Heidelberger Spieleverlag\"}], \"marketplacelistings\"=>{\"listing\"=>{\"listdate\"=>{\"value\"=>\"Sun, 21 Aug 2016 09:31:01 +0000\"}, \"price\"=>{\"currency\"=>\"EUR\", \"value\"=>\"39.00\"}, \"condition\"=>{\"value\"=>\"new\"}, \"notes\"=>{\"value\"=>\"PREORDER - VORBESTELLUNG  SPIEL ERSCHEINT IM NOVEMBER 2016 Zahlung erst wenn das Spiel lieferbar ist.

Giant corporations, sponsored by the World Government on Earth, initiate huge projects to raise the temperature, the oxygen level, and the ocean coverage until the environment is habitable. In Terraforming Mars, you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete for getting victory points that are awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar system, and doing other commendable things.&#10;&#10;The players acquire unique project cards (from over two hundred different ones) by buying them to their hand. The projects (cards) can represent anything from introducing plant life or animals, hurling asteroids at the surface, building cities, to mining the moons of Jupiter and establishing greenhouse gas industries to heat up the atmosphere. The cards can give you immediate bonuses, as well as increasing your production of different resources. Many cards also have requirements and they become playable when the temperature, oxygen, or ocean coverage increases enough. Buying cards is costly, so there is a balance between buying cards (3 megacredits per card) and actually playing them (which can cost anything between 0 to 41 megacredits, depending on the project). Standard Projects are always available to complement your cards.&#10;&#10;Your basic income, as well as your basic score, is based on your Terraform Rating (starting at 20), which increases every time you raise one of the three global parameters. However, your income is complemented with your production, and you also get VPs from many other sources.&#10;&#10;Each player keeps track of their production and resources on their player boards, and the game uses six types of resources: MegaCredits, Steel, Titanium, Plants, Energy, and Heat. On the game board, you compete for the best places for your city tiles, ocean tiles, and greenery tiles. You also compete for different Milestones and Awards worth many VPs. Each round is called a generation (guess why) and consists of the following phases:&#10;&#10;1) Player order shifts clockwise.&#10;2) Research phase: All players buy cards from four privately drawn.&#10;3) Action phase: Players take turns doing 1-2 actions from these options: Playing a card, claiming a Milestone, funding an Award, using a Standard project, converting plant into greenery tiles (and raising oxygen), converting heat into a temperature raise, and using the action of a card in play. The turn continues around the table until all players pass.&#10;4) Production phase: Players get resources according to their terraform rating and production parameters.&#10;&#10;When the three global parameters (temperature, oxygen, ocean) have all reached their goal, the terraforming is complete, and the game ends after that generation. Count your Terraform Rating and other VPs to determine the winning corporation!&#10;&#10;\", \"yearpublished\"=>{\"value\"=>\"2016\"}, \"minplayers\"=>{\"value\"=>\"1\"}, \"maxplayers\"=>{\"value\"=>\"5\"}, \"poll\"=>[{\"results\"=>[{\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"3\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"9\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"3\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"1\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"5\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"9\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"2\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"2\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"10\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"9\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"3\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"14\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"6\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"4\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"4\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"9\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"3\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"5\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"9\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"5+\"}], \"name\"=>\"suggested_numplayers\", \"title\"=>\"User Suggested Number of Players\", \"totalvotes\"=>\"25\"}, {\"results\"=>{\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"2\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"3\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"4\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"5\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"6\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"8\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"10\", \"numvotes\"=>\"7\"}, {\"value\"=>\"12\", \"numvotes\"=>\"2\"}, {\"value\"=>\"14\", \"numvotes\"=>\"2\"}, {\"value\"=>\"16\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"18\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"21 and up\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}]}, \"name\"=>\"suggested_playerage\", \"title\"=>\"User Suggested Player Age\", \"totalvotes\"=>\"11\"}, {\"results\"=>{\"result\"=>[{\"level\"=>\"1\", \"value\"=>\"No necessary in-game text\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"level\"=>\"2\", \"value\"=>\"Some necessary text -

edition (box included) Mansions of Madness 1st edition (box indluded) Mansions of Madness: Call of the Wild expansion (box included . . .obviously)  All 2nd edition cards (except for the large character cards) are sleeved in FFG sleeves.  All 2nd edition components are stored in little plastic containers instead of bags; note the cards are in bags. I turned the 2nd edition box into a two tiered storage space for the figures.  This allows for all of the figures to be glued/remain on their bases and be easily accessed during game play.   Most of the figures have been glued to their bases; there are a few that I haven't because they stay on their base just fine.    All of the other content from the 2nd edition, including all of the characters and tiles from the 1st edition, are stored in the Call of the Wild Box  The remaining first edition stuff is stored in Mansions of Madness 1st edition box.  The cards are not sleeved but the components are stored a small tackle box.  All of the components from the first edition are in good condition with some scuffing on the cards.    There is some scuffing on the corners of the two 1st edition boxes, especially call of the wild though for the most part both boxes are fine.  The first edition box is in mint condition.  Shipping will be about $20 though I will only charge you for what USPS quotes.  I prefer to only ship to  the continental US but am willing to ship elsewhere provided you pay for shipping.

This time Trzewiczek takes the players to a deserted island, where they'll play the parts of shipwreck survivors confronted by an extraordinary adventure. They'll be faced with the challenges of building a shelter, finding food, fighting wild beasts, and protecting themselves from weather changes. Building walls around their homes, animal domestication, constructing weapons and tools from what they find and much more awaits them on the island. The players decide in which direction the game will unfold and &ndash; after several in-game weeks of hard work &ndash; how their settlement will look. Will they manage to discover the secret of the island in the meantime? Will they find a pirate treasure, or an abandoned village? Will they discover an underground city or a cursed temple at the bottom of a volcano? Answers to these questions lie in hundreds of event cards and hundreds of object and structure cards that can be used during the game...&#10;&#10;Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island is an epic game from Portal. You will build a shelter, palisade, weapons, you will create tools like axes, knives, sacks, you will do everything you can to&hellip; to survive. You will have to find food, fight wild beasts, protect yourself from weather changes&hellip;&#10;&#10;Take the role of one of four characters from the ship crew (cook, carpenter, explorer or soldier) and face the adventure. Use your determination skills to help your team mates, discuss with them your plan and put it into practice. Debate, discuss, and work on the best plan you all can make.&#10;&#10;Search for treasures. Discover mysteries. Follow goals of six different, engaging scenarios. Start by building a big pile of wood and setting it on fire to call for help, and then start new adventures. Become an exorcist on cursed Island. Become a treasure hunter on Volcano Island. Become a rescue team for a young lady who&rsquo;s stuck on rock island&hellip;&#10;&#10;Let the adventure live!&#10;&#10;Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island is a co-op game that brings emotions to life from the best novels of Jules Verne and Daniel Defoe. Simple rules are perfectly combined with theme, and allow players to fully imagine dreadful events that take place on a deserted island.&#10;&#10;\", \"yearpublished\"=>{\"value\"=>\"2012\"},

Payment (In order of preference) 1) Bank Transfer - BIC/IBAN (Ireland, UK & Europe only) - Buyer pays transfer fees if any. (Free cross border BIC/IBAN bank transfers within EU countries as far as I know.)  2) PayPal - Select \\\"Send money to friends and family\\\" option to bypass paying fees altogether, no PayPal buyer protection by doing this but you won't need it. (It's always free to send money to friends and family when you use your PayPal Balance or Bank Account) If you can't do this for whatever reason then please add 5 percent of the total cost (Item + P&P) to cover fees. Or buyer pays fees as part of the normal PayPal process when paying for merchandise or services if you really want the payment protection. All my games are exactly as described and are usually posted next working day after payment is received. Any other issues will be swiftly resolved in a professional and courteous manner.  Combined postage for multiple items where possible.   Combined P&P can result in higher shipping costs than for a single item due to different postage weight brackets but 9 times out of 10 it should still be less than shipping the items separately. On some occasions, depending on the items, only slightly less. If the combined items weight is less than 2 Kilo, item(s) will most likely be sent in the Packet weight bracket.

Players can try to achieve one of three different victory conditions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Leadership: Be the leader &mdash; i.e., have more clan figures than any other player &mdash; of territories containing at least six opponents' clans.&#10;     Land: Have your clans present in at least six different territories.&#10;     Religion: Have your clans present in territories that collectively contain at least six shrines.&#10;&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, players also earn deeds, typically chanted by bards or engraved by master crafters, that reduce by one the magic total of six for any condition. While one victory condition is enough to claim the title of King, a game of experienced players usually has a tight balance of power, emphasizing the leadership of the capital of the island.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, players draft a hand of four action cards (with 13 action cards for three players and 17 for four players) during the Assembly. Action cards not played at the end of one season are not held for the next. Players also have access to leader cards for the territories that allow it and where they were elected leader during the assembly. Each Assembly reallocates those cards. Finally, they collect &quot;epic tales&quot; cards that depict the deeds of the ancient Irish gods and heroes, like Cuchulainn, the Dagda, Lugh and many others. These will be kept and used to inspire the clans and achieve extraordinary feats...under the right circumstances. The cards provide a variety of actions: adding clans, moving clans, building/exploring, and special actions.&#10;&#10;Careful drafting, hand management, bluffing (especially once players understand the importance of passing their turn), good timing, and a precise understanding of the balance of power are the keys to victory. After a discovery game you'll be ready for a full and epic game, where an undisputed will be king by the Assembly for his merit and wisdom.&#10;&#10;While Inis has &quot;dudes&quot; that are &quot;on a map&quot;, it's a beginner's mistake to play this as a battle game because eliminating other clans reduces your chances of scoring a Leadership victory condition. Peace among different clans, with or without a clear territory leader, is the usual outcome of a clan's movement. Battles will occur, of course, as the Celtic clans can be unruly and a good player will listen to his clan's people (i.e., his hand of cards). That battle aspect is reflected in the clan's miniatures representing warriors. Woodsmen, shepherds and traders complete the set of twelve minis for each player; these occupations have no impact on the game, but give it flavor.&#10;&#10;\", \"yearpublished\"=>{\"value\"=>\"2016\"}, \"minplayers\"=>{\"value\"=>\"2\"}, \"maxplayers\"=>{\"value\"=>\"4\"}, \"poll\"=>[{\"results\"=>[{\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"2\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"1\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"2\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"1\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"2\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"1\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"2\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"3\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"3\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"4\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"1\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"4+\"}], \"name\"=>\"suggested_numplayers\", \"title\"=>\"User Suggested Number of Players\", \"totalvotes\"=>\"3\"}, {\"results\"=>{\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"2\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"3\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"4\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"5\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"6\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"8\", \"numvotes\"=>\"1\"}, {\"value\"=>\"10\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"12\", \"numvotes\"=>\"2\"}, {\"value\"=>\"14\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"16\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"18\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"21 and up\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}]}, \"name\"=>\"suggested_playerage\", \"title\"=>\"User Suggested Player Age\", \"totalvotes\"=>\"3\"}, {\"results\"=>{\"result\"=>[{\"level\"=>\"1\", \"value\"=>\"No necessary in-game text\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"level\"=>\"2\", \"value\"=>\"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"level\"=>\"3\", \"value\"=>\"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"level\"=>\"4\", \"value\"=>\"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable\", \"numvotes\"=>\"1\"}, {\"level\"=>\"5\", \"value\"=>\"Unplayable in another language\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}]}, \"name\"=>\"language_dependence\", \"title\"=>\"Language Dependence\", \"totalvotes\"=>\"1\"}], \"playingtime\"=>{\"value\"=>\"90\"}, \"minplaytime\"=>{\"value\"=>\"60\"}, \"maxplaytime\"=>{\"value\"=>\"90\"}, \"minage\"=>{\"value\"=>\"14\"}, \"link\"=>[{\"type\"=>\"boardgamecategory\", \"id\"=>\"1050\", \"value\"=>\"Ancient\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamecategory\", \"id\"=>\"1002\", \"value\"=>\"Card Game\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamecategory\", \"id\"=>\"1082\", \"value\"=>\"Mythology\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamemechanic\", \"id\"=>\"2080\", \"value\"=>\"Area Control / Area Influence\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamemechanic\", \"id\"=>\"2046\", \"value\"=>\"Area Movement\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamemechanic\", \"id\"=>\"2041\", \"value\"=>\"Card Drafting\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamemechanic\", \"id\"=>\"2664\", \"value\"=>\"Deck / Pool Building\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamemechanic\", \"id\"=>\"2040\", \"value\"=>\"Hand Management\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamemechanic\", \"id\"=>\"2047\", \"value\"=>\"Memory\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamemechanic\", \"id\"=>\"2002\", \"value\"=>\"Tile Placement\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamefamily\", \"id\"=>\"22783\", \"value\"=>\"Admin: Better Description Needed!\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamefamily\", \"id\"=>\"22184\", \"value\"=>\"Admin: Unreleased Games\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamedesigner\", \"id\"=>\"6997\", \"value\"=>\"Christian Martinez\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgameartist\", \"id\"=>\"30958\", \"value\"=>\"Dimitri Bielak\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgameartist\", \"id\"=>\"44725\", \"value\"=>\"Jim Fitzpatrick\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamepublisher\", \"id\"=>\"5400\", \"value\"=>\"Matagot\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamepublisher\", \"id\"=>\"39\", \"value\"=>\"Pegasus Spiele\"}], \"type\"=>\"boardgame\", \"id\"=>\"155821\"}, \"termsofuse\"=>\"http://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi/termsofuse\"}}"], ["thumbnail", "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3112623_t.jpg"], ["created_at", 2016-09-16 22:45:28 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-09-16 22:45:28 UTC]]

If the government passes a fascist law, players must try to figure out if they were betrayed or simply unlucky. Secret Hitler also features government powers that come into play as fascism advances.

The objective of the fascist team is to pass six fascist policies or elect Secret Hitler chancellor after three fascist policies have passed.&#10;&#10;\", \"yearpublished\"=>{\"value\"=>\"2016\"}, \"minplayers\"=>{\"value\"=>\"5\"}, \"maxplayers\"=>{\"value\"=>\"10\"}, \"poll\"=>[{\"results\"=>[{\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"15\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"1\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"15\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"2\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"15\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"3\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"16\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"4\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"1\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"9\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"10\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"5\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"2\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"11\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"5\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"6\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"9\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"15\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"2\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"7\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"11\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"15\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"2\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"8\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"10\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"13\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"3\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"9\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"17\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"7\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"3\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"10\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"1\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"1\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"11\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"10+\"}], \"name\"=>\"suggested_numplayers\", \"title\"=>\"User Suggested Number of Players\", \"totalvotes\"=>\"31\"}, {\"results\"=>{\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"2\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"3\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"4\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"5\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"6\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"8\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"10\", \"numvotes\"=>\"1\"}, {\"value\"=>\"12\", \"numvotes\"=>\"3\"}, {\"value\"=>\"14\", \"numvotes\"=>\"5\"}, {\"value\"=>\"16\", \"numvotes\"=>\"5\"}, {\"value\"=>\"18\", \"numvotes\"=>\"2\"}, {\"value\"=>\"21 and up\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}]}, \"name\"=>\"suggested_playerage\", \"title\"=>\"User Suggested Player Age\", \"totalvotes\"=>\"16\"}, {\"results\"=>{\"result\"=>[{\"level\"=>\"1\", \"value\"=>\"No necessary in-game text\", \"numvotes\"=>\"3\"}, {\"level\"=>\"2\", \"value\"=>\"Some necessary text -

In Rebellion, you control the entire Galactic Empire or the fledgling Rebel Alliance. You must command starships, account for troop movements, and rally systems to your cause. Given the differences between the Empire and Rebel Alliance, each side has different win conditions, and you'll need to adjust your play style depending on who you represent:&#10;&#10;     As the Imperial player, you can command legions of Stormtroopers, swarms of TIEs, Star Destroyers, and even the Death Star. You rule the galaxy by fear, relying on the power of your massive military to enforce your will. To win the game, you need to snuff out the budding Rebel Alliance by finding its base and obliterating it. Along the way, you can subjugate worlds or even destroy them.&#10;     As the Rebel player, you can command dozens of troopers, T-47 airspeeders, Corellian corvettes, and fighter squadrons. However, these forces are no match for the Imperial military. In terms of raw strength, you'll find yourself clearly overmatched from the very outset, so you'll need to rally the planets to join your cause and execute targeted military strikes to sabotage Imperial build yards and steal valuable intelligence. To win the Galactic Civil War, you'll need to sway the galaxy's citizens to your cause. If you survive long enough and strengthen your reputation, you inspire the galaxy to a full-scale revolt, and you win.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Featuring more than 150 plastic miniatures and two game boards that account for thirty-two of the Star Wars galaxy's most notable systems, Rebellion features a scope that is as large and sweeping as any Star Wars game before it.&#10;&#10;Yet for all its grandiosity, Rebellion remains intensely personal, cinematic, and heroic. As much as your success depends upon the strength of your starships, vehicles, and troops, it depends upon the individual efforts of such notable characters as Leia Organa, Mon Mothma, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Emperor Palpatine. As civil war spreads throughout the galaxy, these leaders are invaluable to your efforts, and the secret missions they attempt will evoke many of the most inspiring moments from the classic trilogy. You might send Luke Skywalker to receive Jedi training on Dagobah or have Darth Vader spring a trap that freezes Han Solo in carbonite!&#10;&#10;\", \"yearpublished\"=>{\"value\"=>\"2016\"}, \"minplayers\"=>{\"value\"=>\"2\"}, \"maxplayers\"=>{\"value\"=>\"4\"}, \"poll\"=>[{\"results\"=>[{\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"1\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"1\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"50\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"1\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"85\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"6\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"1\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"2\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"1\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"17\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"38\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"3\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"4\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"40\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"27\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"4\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"49\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"4+\"}], \"name\"=>\"suggested_numplayers\", \"title\"=>\"User Suggested Number of Players\", \"totalvotes\"=>\"93\"}, {\"results\"=>{\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"2\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"3\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"4\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"5\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"6\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"8\", \"numvotes\"=>\"2\"}, {\"value\"=>\"10\", \"numvotes\"=>\"4\"}, {\"value\"=>\"12\", \"numvotes\"=>\"7\"}, {\"value\"=>\"14\", \"numvotes\"=>\"12\"}, {\"value\"=>\"16\", \"numvotes\"=>\"2\"}, {\"value\"=>\"18\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"21 and up\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}]}, \"name\"=>\"suggested_playerage\", \"title\"=>\"User Suggested Player Age\", \"totalvotes\"=>\"27\"}, {\"results\"=>{\"result\"=>[{\"level\"=>\"1\", \"value\"=>\"No necessary in-game text\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"level\"=>\"2\", \"value\"=>\"Some necessary text -

Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.&#10;&#10;Each player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction&rsquo;s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place).&#10;&#10;Scythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player&rsquo;s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &ldquo;encounter&rdquo; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.&#10;&#10;Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.&#10;&#10;Every part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.&#10;&#10;\", \"yearpublished\"=>{\"value\"=>\"2016\"}, \"minplayers\"=>{\"value\"=>\"1\"}, \"maxplayers\"=>{\"value\"=>\"5\"}, \"poll\"=>[{\"results\"=>[{\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"11\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"46\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"15\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"1\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"4\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"70\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"19\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"2\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"30\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"60\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"4\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"3\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"56\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"38\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"2\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"4\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"30\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"54\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"9\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"5\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"1\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"2\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"47\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"5+\"}], \"name\"=>\"suggested_numplayers\", \"title\"=>\"User Suggested Number of Players\", \"totalvotes\"=>\"120\"}, {\"results\"=>{\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"2\", \"numvotes\"=>\"1\"}, {\"value\"=>\"3\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"4\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"5\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"6\", \"numvotes\"=>\"1\"}, {\"value\"=>\"8\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"10\", \"numvotes\"=>\"8\"}, {\"value\"=>\"12\", \"numvotes\"=>\"15\"}, {\"value\"=>\"14\", \"numvotes\"=>\"4\"}, {\"value\"=>\"16\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"18\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"21 and up\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}]}, \"name\"=>\"suggested_playerage\", \"title\"=>\"User Suggested Player Age\", \"totalvotes\"=>\"29\"}, {\"results\"=>{\"result\"=>[{\"level\"=>\"1\", \"value\"=>\"No necessary in-game text\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"level\"=>\"2\", \"value\"=>\"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet\", \"numvotes\"=>\"2\"}, {\"level\"=>\"3\", \"value\"=>\"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups\", \"numvotes\"=>\"5\"}, {\"level\"=>\"4\", \"value\"=>\"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"level\"=>\"5\", \"value\"=>\"Unplayable in another language\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}]}, \"name\"=>\"language_dependence\", \"title\"=>\"Language Dependence\", \"totalvotes\"=>\"7\"}], \"playingtime\"=>{\"value\"=>\"115\"}, \"minplaytime\"=>{\"value\"=>\"90\"}, \"maxplaytime\"=>{\"value\"=>\"115\"}, \"minage\"=>{\"value\"=>\"14\"}, \"link\"=>[{\"type\"=>\"boardgamecategory\", \"id\"=>\"1021\", \"value\"=>\"Economic\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamecategory\", \"id\"=>\"1013\", \"value\"=>\"Farming\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamecategory\", \"id\"=>\"1046\", \"value\"=>\"Fighting\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamecategory\", \"id\"=>\"1086\", \"value\"=>\"Territory Building\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamemechanic\", \"id\"=>\"2080\", \"value\"=>\"Area Control / Area Influence\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamemechanic\", \"id\"=>\"2046\", \"value\"=>\"Area Movement\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamemechanic\", \"id\"=>\"2015\", \"value\"=>\"Variable Player Powers\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamefamily\", \"id\"=>\"26464\", \"value\"=>\"Alternate History\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamefamily\", \"id\"=>\"8374\", \"value\"=>\"Crowdfunding: Kickstarter\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamefamily\", \"id\"=>\"5666\", \"value\"=>\"Solitaire Games\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgameexpansion\", \"id\"=>\"205121\", \"value\"=>\"Scythe: Encounter Promo Pack #2\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgameexpansion\", \"id\"=>\"199727\", \"value\"=>\"Scythe: Invaders from Afar\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgameexpansion\", \"id\"=>\"204984\", \"value\"=>\"Scythe: Lake Encounter Card\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamedesigner\", \"id\"=>\"62640\", \"value\"=>\"Jamey Stegmaier\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgameartist\", \"id\"=>\"33148\", \"value\"=>\"Jakub Rozalski\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamepublisher\", \"id\"=>\"4785\", \"value\"=>\"Ghenos Games\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamepublisher\", \"id\"=>\"30677\", \"value\"=>\"Maldito Games\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamepublisher\", \"id\"=>\"28323\", \"value\"=>\"Morning\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamepublisher\", \"id\"=>\"23202\", \"value\"=>\"Stonemaier Games\"}], \"marketplacelistings\"=>{\"listing\"=>[{\"listdate\"=>{\"value\"=>\"Wed, 06 Jul 2016 06:54:15 +0000\"}, \"price\"=>{\"currency\"=>\"USD\", \"value\"=>\"199.00\"}, \"condition\"=>{\"value\"=>\"new\"}, \"notes\"=>{\"value\"=>\"Available now!

Now, the great factions of the galaxy mobilize their fleets and race to establish a foothold. The reward for successful domination surpasses all other concerns, and the price for conquering this sector will be paid in lives.&#10;&#10;Forbidden Stars challenges you and up to three other players to take command of a mighty fighting force: the Ultramarines chapter of Space Marines, the Eldar of Craftworld Iyanden, the Evil Sunz Ork clan, or the World Eaters Warband of the Chaos Space Marines. Each faction offers unique armies and play styles, but your goal remains the same &ndash; to claim the key objectives selected for your faction. These objective tokens are scattered throughout the Herakon Cluster, but your opponents are sure to defend your objectives against you. You need to build massive armies and command them in unending war to best your enemies and claim your objectives. The fight for the Herakon Cluster is brutal and bloody, and you will either stride triumphant over the bodies of your fallen foes, or they will do the same to you.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;Each round in Forbidden Stars is divided into three phases.  In the Planning Phase, players will take turns placing order tokens face down on the separate tiles (systems) that make up the game board.  The four types of order tokens that players may place during the Planning Phase correspond to four types of actions that players can resolve in the second phase of play, Operations.  In the Operations Phase, players can reveal a Dominate token to drain friendly planets of their important resources, a Strategize token to purchase cards which can upgrade their orders and combat abilities, a Deploy order which allows them to build cities, factories, bastions, and new mobile units, or an Advance order to move units and attack their enemies.  The last phase of each round is the Refresh Phase, where players profit off of the planets they control, reveal event cards to move the impassable Warp Storms, and heal any units that were wounded in battle.&#10;&#10;Because of the game's three-phase structure, strategy in Forbidden Stars is balanced between short-term bluffing and long-term tactical military action.  The game's setup also poses strategic opportunities.  Players start the game by taking turns assembling sections of the Herakon Cluster, placing individual system tiles along with their own starting forces and the enemy objectives which they must defend.

Blurring the traditional lines between roleplaying and card game experiences, Arkham Horror: The Card Game is a Living Card Game of Lovecraftian mystery, monsters, and madness!&#10;&#10;In the game, you and your friend (or up to three friends with two Core Sets) become characters within the quiet New England town of Arkham. You have your talents, sure, but you also have your flaws. Perhaps you've dabbled a little too much in the writings of the Necronomicon, and its words continue to haunt you. Perhaps you feel compelled to cover up any signs of otherworldly evils, hampering your own investigations in order to protect the quiet confidence of the greater population. Perhaps you'll be scarred by your encounters with a ghoulish cult.&#10;&#10;No matter what compels you, no matter what haunts you, you'll find both your strengths and weaknesses reflected in your custom deck of cards, and these cards will be your resources as you work with your friends to unravel the world's most terrifying mysteries.&#10;&#10;Each of your adventures in Arkham Horror LCG carries you deeper into mystery. You'll find cultists and foul rituals. You'll find haunted houses and strange creatures.

Giant corporations, sponsored by the World Government on Earth, initiate huge projects to raise the temperature, the oxygen level, and the ocean coverage until the environment is habitable. In Terraforming Mars, you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete for getting victory points that are awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar system, and doing other commendable things.&#10;&#10;The players acquire unique project cards (from over two hundred different ones) by buying them to their hand. The projects (cards) can represent anything from introducing plant life or animals, hurling asteroids at the surface, building cities, to mining the moons of Jupiter and establishing greenhouse gas industries to heat up the atmosphere. The cards can give you immediate bonuses, as well as increasing your production of different resources. Many cards also have requirements and they become playable when the temperature, oxygen, or ocean coverage increases enough. Buying cards is costly, so there is a balance between buying cards (3 megacredits per card) and actually playing them (which can cost anything between 0 to 41 megacredits, depending on the project). Standard Projects are always available to complement your cards.&#10;&#10;Your basic income, as well as your basic score, is based on your Terraform Rating (starting at 20), which increases every time you raise one of the three global parameters. However, your income is complemented with your production, and you also get VPs from many other sources.&#10;&#10;Each player keeps track of their production and resources on their player boards, and the game uses six types of resources: MegaCredits, Steel, Titanium, Plants, Energy, and Heat. On the game board, you compete for the best places for your city tiles, ocean tiles, and greenery tiles. You also compete for different Milestones and Awards worth many VPs. Each round is called a generation (guess why) and consists of the following phases:&#10;&#10;1) Player order shifts clockwise.&#10;2) Research phase: All players buy cards from four privately drawn.&#10;3) Action phase: Players take turns doing 1-2 actions from these options: Playing a card, claiming a Milestone, funding an Award, using a Standard project, converting plant into greenery tiles (and raising oxygen), converting heat into a temperature raise, and using the action of a card in play. The turn continues around the table until all players pass.&#10;4) Production phase: Players get resources according to their terraform rating and production parameters.&#10;&#10;When the three global parameters (temperature, oxygen, ocean) have all reached their goal, the terraforming is complete, and the game ends after that generation. Count your Terraform Rating and other VPs to determine the winning corporation!&#10;&#10;\", \"yearpublished\"=>{\"value\"=>\"2016\"}, \"minplayers\"=>{\"value\"=>\"1\"}, \"maxplayers\"=>{\"value\"=>\"5\"}, \"poll\"=>[{\"results\"=>[{\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"3\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"9\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"3\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"1\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"5\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"9\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"2\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"2\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"10\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"9\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"3\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"14\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"6\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"4\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"4\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"9\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"3\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"5\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"9\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"5+\"}], \"name\"=>\"suggested_numplayers\", \"title\"=>\"User Suggested Number of Players\", \"totalvotes\"=>\"25\"}, {\"results\"=>{\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"2\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"3\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"4\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"5\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"6\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"8\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"10\", \"numvotes\"=>\"7\"}, {\"value\"=>\"12\", \"numvotes\"=>\"2\"}, {\"value\"=>\"14\", \"numvotes\"=>\"2\"}, {\"value\"=>\"16\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"18\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"21 and up\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}]}, \"name\"=>\"suggested_playerage\", \"title\"=>\"User Suggested Player Age\", \"totalvotes\"=>\"11\"}, {\"results\"=>{\"result\"=>[{\"level\"=>\"1\", \"value\"=>\"No necessary in-game text\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"level\"=>\"2\", \"value\"=>\"Some necessary text -

edition (box included) Mansions of Madness 1st edition (box indluded) Mansions of Madness: Call of the Wild expansion (box included . . .obviously)  All 2nd edition cards (except for the large character cards) are sleeved in FFG sleeves.  All 2nd edition components are stored in little plastic containers instead of bags; note the cards are in bags. I turned the 2nd edition box into a two tiered storage space for the figures.  This allows for all of the figures to be glued/remain on their bases and be easily accessed during game play.   Most of the figures have been glued to their bases; there are a few that I haven't because they stay on their base just fine.    All of the other content from the 2nd edition, including all of the characters and tiles from the 1st edition, are stored in the Call of the Wild Box  The remaining first edition stuff is stored in Mansions of Madness 1st edition box.  The cards are not sleeved but the components are stored a small tackle box.  All of the components from the first edition are in good condition with some scuffing on the cards.    There is some scuffing on the corners of the two 1st edition boxes, especially call of the wild though for the most part both boxes are fine.  The first edition box is in mint condition.  Shipping will be about $20 though I will only charge you for what USPS quotes.  I prefer to only ship to  the continental US but am willing to ship elsewhere provided you pay for shipping.

This time Trzewiczek takes the players to a deserted island, where they'll play the parts of shipwreck survivors confronted by an extraordinary adventure. They'll be faced with the challenges of building a shelter, finding food, fighting wild beasts, and protecting themselves from weather changes. Building walls around their homes, animal domestication, constructing weapons and tools from what they find and much more awaits them on the island. The players decide in which direction the game will unfold and &ndash; after several in-game weeks of hard work &ndash; how their settlement will look. Will they manage to discover the secret of the island in the meantime? Will they find a pirate treasure, or an abandoned village? Will they discover an underground city or a cursed temple at the bottom of a volcano? Answers to these questions lie in hundreds of event cards and hundreds of object and structure cards that can be used during the game...&#10;&#10;Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island is an epic game from Portal. You will build a shelter, palisade, weapons, you will create tools like axes, knives, sacks, you will do everything you can to&hellip; to survive. You will have to find food, fight wild beasts, protect yourself from weather changes&hellip;&#10;&#10;Take the role of one of four characters from the ship crew (cook, carpenter, explorer or soldier) and face the adventure. Use your determination skills to help your team mates, discuss with them your plan and put it into practice. Debate, discuss, and work on the best plan you all can make.&#10;&#10;Search for treasures. Discover mysteries. Follow goals of six different, engaging scenarios. Start by building a big pile of wood and setting it on fire to call for help, and then start new adventures. Become an exorcist on cursed Island. Become a treasure hunter on Volcano Island. Become a rescue team for a young lady who&rsquo;s stuck on rock island&hellip;&#10;&#10;Let the adventure live!&#10;&#10;Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island is a co-op game that brings emotions to life from the best novels of Jules Verne and Daniel Defoe. Simple rules are perfectly combined with theme, and allow players to fully imagine dreadful events that take place on a deserted island.&#10;&#10;\", \"yearpublished\"=>{\"value\"=>\"2012\"},

(Free cross border BIC/IBAN bank transfers within EU countries as far as I know.)  2) PayPal - Select \\\"Send money to friends and family\\\" option to bypass paying fees altogether, no PayPal buyer protection by doing this but you won't need it. (It's always free to send money to friends and family when you use your PayPal Balance or Bank Account) If you can't do this for whatever reason then please add 5 percent of the total cost (Item + P&P) to cover fees. Or buyer pays fees as part of the normal PayPal process when paying for merchandise or services if you really want the payment protection. All my games are exactly as described and are usually posted next working day after payment is received. Any other issues will be swiftly resolved in a professional and courteous manner.  Combined postage for multiple items where possible.   Combined P&P can result in higher shipping costs than for a single item due to different postage weight brackets but 9 times out of 10 it should still be less than shipping the items separately. On some occasions, depending on the items, only slightly less. If the combined items weight is less than 2 Kilo, item(s) will most likely be sent in the Packet weight bracket. If items can't be split into smaller packets then anything over 2 Kilos is a Registered Parcel and the P&P costs are considerably higher, usually starting between €40 and €45 and increasing in price as the weight increases for various destinations outside Ireland. PM me for further details if required.  All my games for sale come from a smoke and pet free environment.  Feel free to contact me if you have any questions. Best of luck and enjoy if you buy.

Players can try to achieve one of three different victory conditions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Leadership: Be the leader &mdash; i.e., have more clan figures than any other player &mdash; of territories containing at least six opponents' clans.&#10;     Land: Have your clans present in at least six different territories.&#10;     Religion: Have your clans present in territories that collectively contain at least six shrines.&#10;&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, players also earn deeds, typically chanted by bards or engraved by master crafters, that reduce by one the magic total of six for any condition. While one victory condition is enough to claim the title of King, a game of experienced players usually has a tight balance of power, emphasizing the leadership of the capital of the island.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, players draft a hand of four action cards (with 13 action cards for three players and 17 for four players) during the Assembly. Action cards not played at the end of one season are not held for the next. Players also have access to leader cards for the territories that allow it and where they were elected leader during the assembly. Each Assembly reallocates those cards. Finally, they collect &quot;epic tales&quot; cards that depict the deeds of the ancient Irish gods and heroes, like Cuchulainn, the Dagda, Lugh and many others. These will be kept and used to inspire the clans and achieve extraordinary feats...under the right circumstances. The cards provide a variety of actions: adding clans, moving clans, building/exploring, and special actions.&#10;&#10;Careful drafting, hand management, bluffing (especially once players understand the importance of passing their turn), good timing, and a precise understanding of the balance of power are the keys to victory. After a discovery game you'll be ready for a full and epic game, where an undisputed will be king by the Assembly for his merit and wisdom.&#10;&#10;While Inis has &quot;dudes&quot; that are &quot;on a map&quot;, it's a beginner's mistake to play this as a battle game because eliminating other clans reduces your chances of scoring a Leadership victory condition. Peace among different clans, with or without a clear territory leader, is the usual outcome of a clan's movement. Battles will occur, of course, as the Celtic clans can be unruly and a good player will listen to his clan's people (i.e., his hand of cards). That battle aspect is reflected in the clan's miniatures representing warriors. Woodsmen, shepherds and traders complete the set of twelve minis for each player; these occupations have no impact on the game, but give it flavor.&#10;&#10;\", \"yearpublished\"=>{\"value\"=>\"2016\"}, \"minplayers\"=>{\"value\"=>\"2\"}, \"maxplayers\"=>{\"value\"=>\"4\"}, \"poll\"=>[{\"results\"=>[{\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"2\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"1\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"2\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"1\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"2\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"1\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"2\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"3\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"3\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"4\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"1\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"4+\"}], \"name\"=>\"suggested_numplayers\", \"title\"=>\"User Suggested Number of Players\", \"totalvotes\"=>\"3\"}, {\"results\"=>{\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"2\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"3\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"4\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"5\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"6\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"8\", \"numvotes\"=>\"1\"}, {\"value\"=>\"10\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"12\", \"numvotes\"=>\"2\"}, {\"value\"=>\"14\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"16\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"18\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"21 and up\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}]}, \"name\"=>\"suggested_playerage\", \"title\"=>\"User Suggested Player Age\", \"totalvotes\"=>\"3\"}, {\"results\"=>{\"result\"=>[{\"level\"=>\"1\", \"value\"=>\"No necessary in-game text\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"level\"=>\"2\", \"value\"=>\"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"level\"=>\"3\", \"value\"=>\"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"level\"=>\"4\", \"value\"=>\"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable\", \"numvotes\"=>\"1\"}, {\"level\"=>\"5\", \"value\"=>\"Unplayable in another language\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}]}, \"name\"=>\"language_dependence\", \"title\"=>\"Language Dependence\", \"totalvotes\"=>\"1\"}], \"playingtime\"=>{\"value\"=>\"90\"}, \"minplaytime\"=>{\"value\"=>\"60\"}, \"maxplaytime\"=>{\"value\"=>\"90\"}, \"minage\"=>{\"value\"=>\"14\"}, \"link\"=>[{\"type\"=>\"boardgamecategory\", \"id\"=>\"1050\", \"value\"=>\"Ancient\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamecategory\", \"id\"=>\"1002\", \"value\"=>\"Card Game\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamecategory\", \"id\"=>\"1082\", \"value\"=>\"Mythology\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamemechanic\", \"id\"=>\"2080\", \"value\"=>\"Area Control / Area Influence\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamemechanic\", \"id\"=>\"2046\", \"value\"=>\"Area Movement\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamemechanic\", \"id\"=>\"2041\", \"value\"=>\"Card Drafting\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamemechanic\", \"id\"=>\"2664\", \"value\"=>\"Deck / Pool Building\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamemechanic\", \"id\"=>\"2040\", \"value\"=>\"Hand Management\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamemechanic\", \"id\"=>\"2047\", \"value\"=>\"Memory\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamemechanic\", \"id\"=>\"2002\", \"value\"=>\"Tile Placement\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamefamily\", \"id\"=>\"22783\", \"value\"=>\"Admin: Better Description Needed!\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamefamily\", \"id\"=>\"22184\", \"value\"=>\"Admin: Unreleased Games\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamedesigner\", \"id\"=>\"6997\", \"value\"=>\"Christian Martinez\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgameartist\", \"id\"=>\"30958\", \"value\"=>\"Dimitri Bielak\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgameartist\", \"id\"=>\"44725\", \"value\"=>\"Jim Fitzpatrick\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamepublisher\", \"id\"=>\"5400\", \"value\"=>\"Matagot\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamepublisher\", \"id\"=>\"39\", \"value\"=>\"Pegasus Spiele\"}], \"type\"=>\"boardgame\", \"id\"=>\"155821\"}, \"termsofuse\"=>\"http://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi/termsofuse\"}}"], ["thumbnail", "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3112623_t.jpg"], ["created_at", 2016-09-16 22:49:03 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-09-16 22:49:03 UTC]]

In Rebellion, you control the entire Galactic Empire or the fledgling Rebel Alliance. You must command starships, account for troop movements, and rally systems to your cause. Given the differences between the Empire and Rebel Alliance, each side has different win conditions, and you'll need to adjust your play style depending on who you represent:&#10;&#10;     As the Imperial player, you can command legions of Stormtroopers, swarms of TIEs, Star Destroyers, and even the Death Star. You rule the galaxy by fear, relying on the power of your massive military to enforce your will. To win the game, you need to snuff out the budding Rebel Alliance by finding its base and obliterating it. Along the way, you can subjugate worlds or even destroy them.&#10;     As the Rebel player, you can command dozens of troopers, T-47 airspeeders, Corellian corvettes, and fighter squadrons. However, these forces are no match for the Imperial military. In terms of raw strength, you'll find yourself clearly overmatched from the very outset, so you'll need to rally the planets to join your cause and execute targeted military strikes to sabotage Imperial build yards and steal valuable intelligence. To win the Galactic Civil War, you'll need to sway the galaxy's citizens to your cause. If you survive long enough and strengthen your reputation, you inspire the galaxy to a full-scale revolt, and you win.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Featuring more than 150 plastic miniatures and two game boards that account for thirty-two of the Star Wars galaxy's most notable systems, Rebellion features a scope that is as large and sweeping as any Star Wars game before it.&#10;&#10;Yet for all its grandiosity, Rebellion remains intensely personal, cinematic, and heroic. As much as your success depends upon the strength of your starships, vehicles, and troops, it depends upon the individual efforts of such notable characters as Leia Organa, Mon Mothma, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Emperor Palpatine. As civil war spreads throughout the galaxy, these leaders are invaluable to your efforts, and the secret missions they attempt will evoke many of the most inspiring moments from the classic trilogy. You might send Luke Skywalker to receive Jedi training on Dagobah or have Darth Vader spring a trap that freezes Han Solo in carbonite!&#10;&#10;\", \"yearpublished\"=>{\"value\"=>\"2016\"}, \"minplayers\"=>{\"value\"=>\"2\"}, \"maxplayers\"=>{\"value\"=>\"4\"}, \"poll\"=>[{\"results\"=>[{\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"1\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"1\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"50\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"1\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"85\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"6\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"1\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"2\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"1\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"17\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"38\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"3\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"4\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"40\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"27\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"4\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"49\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"4+\"}], \"name\"=>\"suggested_numplayers\", \"title\"=>\"User Suggested Number of Players\", \"totalvotes\"=>\"93\"}, {\"results\"=>{\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"2\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"3\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"4\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"5\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"6\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"8\", \"numvotes\"=>\"2\"}, {\"value\"=>\"10\", \"numvotes\"=>\"4\"}, {\"value\"=>\"12\", \"numvotes\"=>\"7\"}, {\"value\"=>\"14\", \"numvotes\"=>\"12\"}, {\"value\"=>\"16\", \"numvotes\"=>\"2\"}, {\"value\"=>\"18\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"21 and up\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}]}, \"name\"=>\"suggested_playerage\", \"title\"=>\"User Suggested Player Age\", \"totalvotes\"=>\"27\"}, {\"results\"=>{\"result\"=>[{\"level\"=>\"1\", \"value\"=>\"No necessary in-game text\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"level\"=>\"2\", \"value\"=>\"Some necessary text -

With an infinite combination of planets and interstellar phenomena, no two games of Star Trek: Ascendancy will ever play the same!&#10;&#10;\", \"yearpublished\"=>{\"value\"=>\"2016\"}, \"minplayers\"=>{\"value\"=>\"3\"}, \"maxplayers\"=>{\"value\"=>\"3\"}, \"poll\"=>[{\"results\"=>[{\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"5\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"1\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"5\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"2\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"4\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"1\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"3\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"1\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"1\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"3+\"}], \"name\"=>\"suggested_numplayers\", \"title\"=>\"User Suggested Number of Players\", \"totalvotes\"=>\"5\"}, {\"results\"=>{\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"2\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"3\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"4\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"5\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"6\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"8\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"10\", \"numvotes\"=>\"1\"}, {\"value\"=>\"12\", \"numvotes\"=>\"1\"}, {\"value\"=>\"14\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"16\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"18\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"21 and up\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}]}, \"name\"=>\"suggested_playerage\", \"title\"=>\"User Suggested Player Age\", \"totalvotes\"=>\"2\"}, {\"results\"=>{\"result\"=>[{\"level\"=>\"1\", \"value\"=>\"No necessary in-game text\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"level\"=>\"2\", \"value\"=>\"Some necessary text -

You must select the correct tasks while being mindful of quickly accumulating pit water, for it can stall your efforts and prevent your extraction of valuable coal.&#10;&#10;&#226;&#128;&#168;The game offers a lot of variation and replayability through unique methods in setting-up the development tiles.&#10;&#10;\", \"yearpublished\"=>{\"value\"=>\"2015\"}, \"minplayers\"=>{\"value\"=>\"2\"}, \"maxplayers\"=>{\"value\"=>\"4\"}, \"poll\"=>[{\"results\"=>[{\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"5\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"1\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"3\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"3\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"2\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"5\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"4\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"3\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"6\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"6\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"4\"}, {\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"Best\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"Not Recommended\", \"numvotes\"=>\"4\"}], \"numplayers\"=>\"4+\"}], \"name\"=>\"suggested_numplayers\", \"title\"=>\"User Suggested Number of Players\", \"totalvotes\"=>\"13\"}, {\"results\"=>{\"result\"=>[{\"value\"=>\"2\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"3\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"4\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"5\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"6\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"8\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"10\", \"numvotes\"=>\"1\"}, {\"value\"=>\"12\", \"numvotes\"=>\"2\"}, {\"value\"=>\"14\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"16\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"18\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"value\"=>\"21 and up\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}]}, \"name\"=>\"suggested_playerage\", \"title\"=>\"User Suggested Player Age\", \"totalvotes\"=>\"3\"}, {\"results\"=>{\"result\"=>[{\"level\"=>\"1\", \"value\"=>\"No necessary in-game text\", \"numvotes\"=>\"7\"}, {\"level\"=>\"2\", \"value\"=>\"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"level\"=>\"3\", \"value\"=>\"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"level\"=>\"4\", \"value\"=>\"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}, {\"level\"=>\"5\", \"value\"=>\"Unplayable in another language\", \"numvotes\"=>\"0\"}]}, \"name\"=>\"language_dependence\", \"title\"=>\"Language Dependence\", \"totalvotes\"=>\"7\"}], \"playingtime\"=>{\"value\"=>\"90\"}, \"minplaytime\"=>{\"value\"=>\"60\"}, \"maxplaytime\"=>{\"value\"=>\"90\"}, \"minage\"=>{\"value\"=>\"12\"}, \"link\"=>[{\"type\"=>\"boardgamecategory\", \"id\"=>\"1084\", \"value\"=>\"Environmental\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamecategory\", \"id\"=>\"1013\", \"value\"=>\"Farming\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamemechanic\", \"id\"=>\"2001\", \"value\"=>\"Action Point Allowance System\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamemechanic\", \"id\"=>\"2082\", \"value\"=>\"Worker Placement\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamefamily\", \"id\"=>\"33782\", \"value\"=>\"Coal Series\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamefamily\", \"id\"=>\"21425\", \"value\"=>\"Mining\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamefamily\", \"id\"=>\"129\", \"value\"=>\"Quined Master Print Edition Series\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamedesigner\", \"id\"=>\"63549\", \"value\"=>\"Thomas Spitzer\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgameartist\", \"id\"=>\"70631\", \"value\"=>\"Johannes Sich\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamepublisher\", \"id\"=>\"10663\", \"value\"=>\"Quined Games\"}, {\"type\"=>\"boardgamepublisher\", \"id\"=>\"30958\", \"value\"=>\"Capstone Games\"}], \"marketplacelistings\"=>{\"listing\"=>[{\"listdate\"=>{\"value\"=>\"Fri, 29 Apr 2016 06:58:15 +0000\"}, \"price\"=>{\"currency\"=>\"USD\", \"value\"=>\"70.00\"}, \"condition\"=>{\"value\"=>\"verygood\"}, \"notes\"=>{\"value\"=>\"Excellent condition.

The ashes from the first great war still darken the snow. The capitalistic city-state known simply as &ldquo;The Factory&rdquo;, which fueled the war with heavily armored mechs, has closed its doors, drawing the attention of several nearby countries.&#10;&#10;Scythe is a 4X board game set in an alternate-history 1920s period. It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player represents a character from one of five factions of Eastern Europa who are attempting to earn their fortune and claim their faction's stake in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.&#10;&#10;Each player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction&rsquo;s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place).&#10;&#10;Scythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player&rsquo;s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &ldquo;encounter&rdquo; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.&#10;&#10;Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.&#10;&#10;Every part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.&#10;&#10;"], ["thumbnail", "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3163924_t.jpg"], ["created_at", 2016-09-16 23:03:56 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-09-16 23:03:56 UTC]]

Now, the great factions of the galaxy mobilize their fleets and race to establish a foothold. The reward for successful domination surpasses all other concerns, and the price for conquering this sector will be paid in lives.&#10;&#10;Forbidden Stars challenges you and up to three other players to take command of a mighty fighting force: the Ultramarines chapter of Space Marines, the Eldar of Craftworld Iyanden, the Evil Sunz Ork clan, or the World Eaters Warband of the Chaos Space Marines. Each faction offers unique armies and play styles, but your goal remains the same &ndash; to claim the key objectives selected for your faction. These objective tokens are scattered throughout the Herakon Cluster, but your opponents are sure to defend your objectives against you. You need to build massive armies and command them in unending war to best your enemies and claim your objectives. The fight for the Herakon Cluster is brutal and bloody, and you will either stride triumphant over the bodies of your fallen foes, or they will do the same to you.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;Each round in Forbidden Stars is divided into three phases.  In the Planning Phase, players will take turns placing order tokens face down on the separate tiles (systems) that make up the game board.  The four types of order tokens that players may place during the Planning Phase correspond to four types of actions that players can resolve in the second phase of play, Operations.  In the Operations Phase, players can reveal a Dominate token to drain friendly planets of their important resources, a Strategize token to purchase cards which can upgrade their orders and combat abilities, a Deploy order which allows them to build cities, factories, bastions, and new mobile units, or an Advance order to move units and attack their enemies.  The last phase of each round is the Refresh Phase, where players profit off of the planets they control, reveal event cards to move the impassable Warp Storms, and heal any units that were wounded in battle.&#10;&#10;Because of the game's three-phase structure, strategy in Forbidden Stars is balanced between short-term bluffing and long-term tactical military action.  The game's setup also poses strategic opportunities.  Players start the game by taking turns assembling sections of the Herakon Cluster, placing individual system tiles along with their own starting forces and the enemy objectives which they must defend.  This intentional construction, along with the unique Domination abilities of the game's four factions, means that Forbidden Stars will see players working to best utilize their own force's strengths while exploiting the weaknesses of their opponents.&#10;&#10;"], ["thumbnail", "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2471359_t.jpg"], ["created_at", 2016-09-16 23:03:56 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-09-16 23:03:56 UTC]]

The cards can give you immediate bonuses, as well as increasing your production of different resources. Many cards also have requirements and they become playable when the temperature, oxygen, or ocean coverage increases enough.

Standard Projects are always available to complement your cards.&#10;&#10;Your basic income, as well as your basic score, is based on your Terraform Rating (starting at 20), which increases every time you raise one of the three global parameters.

Each round is called a generation (guess why) and consists of the following phases:&#10;&#10;1) Player order shifts clockwise.&#10;2) Research phase: All players buy cards from four privately drawn.&#10;3) Action phase: Players take turns doing 1-2 actions from these options: Playing a card, claiming a Milestone, funding an Award, using a Standard project, converting plant into greenery tiles (and raising oxygen), converting heat into a temperature raise, and using the action of a card in play. The turn continues around the table until all players pass.&#10;4) Production phase: Players get resources according to their terraform rating and production parameters.&#10;&#10;When the three global parameters (temperature, oxygen, ocean) have all reached their goal, the terraforming is complete, and the game ends after that generation.

Players can try to achieve one of three different victory conditions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Leadership: Be the leader &mdash; i.e., have more clan figures than any other player &mdash; of territories containing at least six opponents' clans.&#10;     Land: Have your clans present in at least six different territories.&#10;     Religion: Have your clans present in territories that collectively contain at least six shrines.&#10;&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, players also earn deeds, typically chanted by bards or engraved by master crafters, that reduce by one the magic total of six for any condition. While one victory condition is enough to claim the title of King, a game of experienced players usually has a tight balance of power, emphasizing the leadership of the capital of the island.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, players draft a hand of four action cards (with 13 action cards for three players and 17 for four players) during the Assembly. Action cards not played at the end of one season are not held for the next. Players also have access to leader cards for the territories that allow it and where they were elected leader during the assembly. Each Assembly reallocates those cards. Finally, they collect &quot;epic tales&quot; cards that depict the deeds of the ancient Irish gods and heroes, like Cuchulainn, the Dagda, Lugh and many others. These will be kept and used to inspire the clans and achieve extraordinary feats...under the right circumstances. The cards provide a variety of actions: adding clans, moving clans, building/exploring, and special actions.&#10;&#10;Careful drafting, hand management, bluffing (especially once players understand the importance of passing their turn), good timing, and a precise understanding of the balance of power are the keys to victory. After a discovery game you'll be ready for a full and epic game, where an undisputed will be king by the Assembly for his merit and wisdom.&#10;&#10;While Inis has &quot;dudes&quot; that are &quot;on a map&quot;, it's a beginner's mistake to play this as a battle game because eliminating other clans reduces your chances of scoring a Leadership victory condition. Peace among different clans, with or without a clear territory leader, is the usual outcome of a clan's movement. Battles will occur, of course, as the Celtic clans can be unruly and a good player will listen to his clan's people (i.e., his hand of cards). That battle aspect is reflected in the clan's miniatures representing warriors. Woodsmen, shepherds and traders complete the set of twelve minis for each player; these occupations have no impact on the game, but give it flavor.&#10;&#10;"], ["thumbnail", "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3112623_t.jpg"], ["created_at", 2016-09-16 23:03:58 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-09-16 23:03:58 UTC]]

Given the differences between the Empire and Rebel Alliance, each side has different win conditions, and you'll need to adjust your play style depending on who you represent:&#10;&#10;     As the Imperial player, you can command legions of Stormtroopers, swarms of TIEs, Star Destroyers, and even the Death Star. You rule the galaxy by fear, relying on the power of your massive military to enforce your will. To win the game, you need to snuff out the budding Rebel Alliance by finding its base and obliterating it. Along the way, you can subjugate worlds or even destroy them.&#10;     As the Rebel player, you can command dozens of troopers, T-47 airspeeders, Corellian corvettes, and fighter squadrons. However, these forces are no match for the Imperial military. In terms of raw strength, you'll find yourself clearly overmatched from the very outset, so you'll need to rally the planets to join your cause and execute targeted military strikes to sabotage Imperial build yards and steal valuable intelligence.

As much as your success depends upon the strength of your starships, vehicles, and troops, it depends upon the individual efforts of such notable characters as Leia Organa, Mon Mothma, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Emperor Palpatine. As civil war spreads throughout the galaxy, these leaders are invaluable to your efforts, and the secret missions they attempt will evoke many of the most inspiring moments from the classic trilogy.

The ashes from the first great war still darken the snow. The capitalistic city-state known simply as &ldquo;The Factory&rdquo;, which fueled the war with heavily armored mechs, has closed its doors, drawing the attention of several nearby countries.&#10;&#10;Scythe is a 4X board game set in an alternate-history 1920s period. It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player represents a character from one of five factions of Eastern Europa who are attempting to earn their fortune and claim their faction's stake in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.&#10;&#10;Each player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction&rsquo;s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place).&#10;&#10;Scythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player&rsquo;s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &ldquo;encounter&rdquo; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.&#10;&#10;Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.&#10;&#10;Every part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.&#10;&#10;"], ["thumbnail", "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3163924_t.jpg"], ["created_at", 2016-09-16 23:07:02 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-09-16 23:07:02 UTC]]

Now, the great factions of the galaxy mobilize their fleets and race to establish a foothold. The reward for successful domination surpasses all other concerns, and the price for conquering this sector will be paid in lives.&#10;&#10;Forbidden Stars challenges you and up to three other players to take command of a mighty fighting force: the Ultramarines chapter of Space Marines, the Eldar of Craftworld Iyanden, the Evil Sunz Ork clan, or the World Eaters Warband of the Chaos Space Marines. Each faction offers unique armies and play styles, but your goal remains the same &ndash; to claim the key objectives selected for your faction. These objective tokens are scattered throughout the Herakon Cluster, but your opponents are sure to defend your objectives against you. You need to build massive armies and command them in unending war to best your enemies and claim your objectives. The fight for the Herakon Cluster is brutal and bloody, and you will either stride triumphant over the bodies of your fallen foes, or they will do the same to you.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;Each round in Forbidden Stars is divided into three phases.  In the Planning Phase, players will take turns placing order tokens face down on the separate tiles (systems) that make up the game board.  The four types of order tokens that players may place during the Planning Phase correspond to four types of actions that players can resolve in the second phase of play, Operations.  In the Operations Phase, players can reveal a Dominate token to drain friendly planets of their important resources, a Strategize token to purchase cards which can upgrade their orders and combat abilities, a Deploy order which allows them to build cities, factories, bastions, and new mobile units, or an Advance order to move units and attack their enemies.  The last phase of each round is the Refresh Phase, where players profit off of the planets they control, reveal event cards to move the impassable Warp Storms, and heal any units that were wounded in battle.&#10;&#10;Because of the game's three-phase structure, strategy in Forbidden Stars is balanced between short-term bluffing and long-term tactical military action.  The game's setup also poses strategic opportunities.  Players start the game by taking turns assembling sections of the Herakon Cluster, placing individual system tiles along with their own starting forces and the enemy objectives which they must defend.  This intentional construction, along with the unique Domination abilities of the game's four factions, means that Forbidden Stars will see players working to best utilize their own force's strengths while exploiting the weaknesses of their opponents.&#10;&#10;"], ["thumbnail", "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2471359_t.jpg"], ["created_at", 2016-09-16 23:07:02 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-09-16 23:07:02 UTC]]

The cards can give you immediate bonuses, as well as increasing your production of different resources.

Each round is called a generation (guess why) and consists of the following phases:&#10;&#10;1) Player order shifts clockwise.&#10;2) Research phase: All players buy cards from four privately drawn.&#10;3) Action phase: Players take turns doing 1-2 actions from these options: Playing a card, claiming a Milestone, funding an Award, using a Standard project, converting plant into greenery tiles (and raising oxygen), converting heat into a temperature raise, and using the action of a card in play. The turn continues around the table until all players pass.&#10;4) Production phase: Players get resources according to their terraform rating and production parameters.&#10;&#10;When the three global parameters (temperature, oxygen, ocean) have all reached their goal, the terraforming is complete, and the game ends after that generation.

While one victory condition is enough to claim the title of King, a game of experienced players usually has a tight balance of power, emphasizing the leadership of the capital of the island.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, players draft a hand of four action cards (with 13 action cards for three players and 17 for four players) during the Assembly. Action cards not played at the end of one season are not held for the next. Players also have access to leader cards for the territories that allow it and where they were elected leader during the assembly. Each Assembly reallocates those cards. Finally, they collect &quot;epic tales&quot; cards that depict the deeds of the ancient Irish gods and heroes, like Cuchulainn, the Dagda, Lugh and many others. These will be kept and used to inspire the clans and achieve extraordinary feats...under the right circumstances. The cards provide a variety of actions: adding clans, moving clans, building/exploring, and special actions.&#10;&#10;Careful drafting, hand management, bluffing (especially once players understand the importance of passing their turn), good timing, and a precise understanding of the balance of power are the keys to victory. After a discovery game you'll be ready for a full and epic game, where an undisputed will be king by the Assembly for his merit and wisdom.&#10;&#10;While Inis has &quot;dudes&quot; that are &quot;on a map&quot;, it's a beginner's mistake to play this as a battle game because eliminating other clans reduces your chances of scoring a Leadership victory condition. Peace among different clans, with or without a clear territory leader, is the usual outcome of a clan's movement. Battles will occur, of course, as the Celtic clans can be unruly and a good player will listen to his clan's people (i.e., his hand of cards). That battle aspect is reflected in the clan's miniatures representing warriors. Woodsmen, shepherds and traders complete the set of twelve minis for each player; these occupations have no impact on the game, but give it flavor.&#10;&#10;"], ["thumbnail", "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3112623_t.jpg"], ["created_at", 2016-09-16 23:07:04 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-09-16 23:07:04 UTC]]

In Rebellion, you control the entire Galactic Empire or the fledgling Rebel Alliance. You must command starships, account for troop movements, and rally systems to your cause. Given the differences between the Empire and Rebel Alliance, each side has different win conditions, and you'll need to adjust your play style depending on who you represent:&#10;&#10;     As the Imperial player, you can command legions of Stormtroopers, swarms of TIEs, Star Destroyers, and even the Death Star. You rule the galaxy by fear, relying on the power of your massive military to enforce your will. To win the game, you need to snuff out the budding Rebel Alliance by finding its base and obliterating it. Along the way, you can subjugate worlds or even destroy them.&#10;     As the Rebel player, you can command dozens of troopers, T-47 airspeeders, Corellian corvettes, and fighter squadrons. However, these forces are no match for the Imperial military. In terms of raw strength, you'll find yourself clearly overmatched from the very outset, so you'll need to rally the planets to join your cause and execute targeted military strikes to sabotage Imperial build yards and steal valuable intelligence. To win the Galactic Civil War, you'll need to sway the galaxy's citizens to your cause. If you survive long enough and strengthen your reputation, you inspire the galaxy to a full-scale revolt, and you win.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Featuring more than 150 plastic miniatures and two game boards that account for thirty-two of the Star Wars galaxy's most notable systems, Rebellion features a scope that is as large and sweeping as any Star Wars game before it.&#10;&#10;Yet for all its grandiosity, Rebellion remains intensely personal, cinematic, and heroic. As much as your success depends upon the strength of your starships, vehicles, and troops, it depends upon the individual efforts of such notable characters as Leia Organa, Mon Mothma, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Emperor Palpatine. As civil war spreads throughout the galaxy, these leaders are invaluable to your efforts, and the secret missions they attempt will evoke many of the most inspiring moments from the classic trilogy.

The ashes from the first great war still darken the snow.

It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player represents a character from one of five factions of Eastern Europa who are attempting to earn their fortune and claim their faction's stake in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.&#10;&#10;Each player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction&rsquo;s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place).&#10;&#10;Scythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player&rsquo;s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &ldquo;encounter&rdquo; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.&#10;&#10;Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.&#10;&#10;Every part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.&#10;&#10;"], ["thumbnail", "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3163924_t.jpg"], ["created_at", 2016-09-16 23:10:33 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-09-16 23:10:33 UTC]]

The reward for successful domination surpasses all other concerns, and the price for conquering this sector will be paid in lives.&#10;&#10;Forbidden Stars challenges you and up to three other players to take command of a mighty fighting force: the Ultramarines chapter of Space Marines, the Eldar of Craftworld Iyanden, the Evil Sunz Ork clan, or the World Eaters Warband of the Chaos Space Marines. Each faction offers unique armies and play styles, but your goal remains the same &ndash; to claim the key objectives selected for your faction. These objective tokens are scattered throughout the Herakon Cluster, but your opponents are sure to defend your objectives against you. You need to build massive armies and command them in unending war to best your enemies and claim your objectives. The fight for the Herakon Cluster is brutal and bloody, and you will either stride triumphant over the bodies of your fallen foes, or they will do the same to you.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;Each round in Forbidden Stars is divided into three phases.  In the Planning Phase, players will take turns placing order tokens face down on the separate tiles (systems) that make up the game board.  The four types of order tokens that players may place during the Planning Phase correspond to four types of actions that players can resolve in the second phase of play, Operations.  In the Operations Phase, players can reveal a Dominate token to drain friendly planets of their important resources, a Strategize token to purchase cards which can upgrade their orders and combat abilities, a Deploy order which allows them to build cities, factories, bastions, and new mobile units, or an Advance order to move units and attack their enemies.  The last phase of each round is the Refresh Phase, where players profit off of the planets they control, reveal event cards to move the impassable Warp Storms, and heal any units that were wounded in battle.&#10;&#10;Because of the game's three-phase structure, strategy in Forbidden Stars is balanced between short-term bluffing and long-term tactical military action.  The game's setup also poses strategic opportunities.  Players start the game by taking turns assembling sections of the Herakon Cluster, placing individual system tiles along with their own starting forces and the enemy objectives which they must defend.  This intentional construction, along with the unique Domination abilities of the game's four factions, means that Forbidden Stars will see players working to best utilize their own force's strengths while exploiting the weaknesses of their opponents.&#10;&#10;"], ["thumbnail", "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2471359_t.jpg"], ["created_at", 2016-09-16 23:10:33 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-09-16 23:10:33 UTC]]

Players can try to achieve one of three different victory conditions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Leadership: Be the leader &mdash; i.e., have more clan figures than any other player &mdash; of territories containing at least six opponents' clans.&#10;     Land: Have your clans present in at least six different territories.&#10;     Religion: Have your clans present in territories that collectively contain at least six shrines.&#10;&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, players also earn deeds, typically chanted by bards or engraved by master crafters, that reduce by one the magic total of six for any condition. While one victory condition is enough to claim the title of King, a game of experienced players usually has a tight balance of power, emphasizing the leadership of the capital of the island.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, players draft a hand of four action cards (with 13 action cards for three players and 17 for four players) during the Assembly. Action cards not played at the end of one season are not held for the next. Players also have access to leader cards for the territories that allow it and where they were elected leader during the assembly. Each Assembly reallocates those cards. Finally, they collect &quot;epic tales&quot; cards that depict the deeds of the ancient Irish gods and heroes, like Cuchulainn, the Dagda, Lugh and many others. These will be kept and used to inspire the clans and achieve extraordinary feats...under the right circumstances. The cards provide a variety of actions: adding clans, moving clans, building/exploring, and special actions.&#10;&#10;Careful drafting, hand management, bluffing (especially once players understand the importance of passing their turn), good timing, and a precise understanding of the balance of power are the keys to victory. After a discovery game you'll be ready for a full and epic game, where an undisputed will be king by the Assembly for his merit and wisdom.&#10;&#10;While Inis has &quot;dudes&quot; that are &quot;on a map&quot;, it's a beginner's mistake to play this as a battle game because eliminating other clans reduces your chances of scoring a Leadership victory condition. Peace among different clans, with or without a clear territory leader, is the usual outcome of a clan's movement. Battles will occur, of course, as the Celtic clans can be unruly and a good player will listen to his clan's people (i.e., his hand of cards). That battle aspect is reflected in the clan's miniatures representing warriors. Woodsmen, shepherds and traders complete the set of twelve minis for each player; these occupations have no impact on the game, but give it flavor.&#10;&#10;"], ["thumbnail", "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3112623_t.jpg"], ["created_at", 2016-09-16 23:10:35 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-09-16 23:10:35 UTC]]

The ashes from the first great war still darken the snow. The capitalistic city-state known simply as &ldquo;The Factory&rdquo;, which fueled the war with heavily armored mechs, has closed its doors, drawing the attention of several nearby countries.&#10;&#10;Scythe is a 4X board game set in an alternate-history 1920s period. It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player represents a character from one of five factions of Eastern Europa who are attempting to earn their fortune and claim their faction's stake in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.&#10;&#10;Each player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction&rsquo;s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place).&#10;&#10;Scythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player&rsquo;s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &ldquo;encounter&rdquo; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.&#10;&#10;Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.&#10;&#10;Every part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.&#10;&#10;\"]"], ["thumbnail", "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3163924_t.jpg"], ["created_at", 2016-09-16 23:14:52 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-09-16 23:14:52 UTC]]

Now, the great factions of the galaxy mobilize their fleets and race to establish a foothold. The reward for successful domination surpasses all other concerns, and the price for conquering this sector will be paid in lives.&#10;&#10;Forbidden Stars challenges you and up to three other players to take command of a mighty fighting force: the Ultramarines chapter of Space Marines, the Eldar of Craftworld Iyanden, the Evil Sunz Ork clan, or the World Eaters Warband of the Chaos Space Marines. Each faction offers unique armies and play styles, but your goal remains the same &ndash; to claim the key objectives selected for your faction. These objective tokens are scattered throughout the Herakon Cluster, but your opponents are sure to defend your objectives against you. You need to build massive armies and command them in unending war to best your enemies and claim your objectives. The fight for the Herakon Cluster is brutal and bloody, and you will either stride triumphant over the bodies of your fallen foes, or they will do the same to you.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;Each round in Forbidden Stars is divided into three phases.  In the Planning Phase, players will take turns placing order tokens face down on the separate tiles (systems) that make up the game board.  The four types of order tokens that players may place during the Planning Phase correspond to four types of actions that players can resolve in the second phase of play, Operations.  In the Operations Phase, players can reveal a Dominate token to drain friendly planets of their important resources, a Strategize token to purchase cards which can upgrade their orders and combat abilities, a Deploy order which allows them to build cities, factories, bastions, and new mobile units, or an Advance order to move units and attack their enemies.  The last phase of each round is the Refresh Phase, where players profit off of the planets they control, reveal event cards to move the impassable Warp Storms, and heal any units that were wounded in battle.&#10;&#10;Because of the game's three-phase structure, strategy in Forbidden Stars is balanced between short-term bluffing and long-term tactical military action.  The game's setup also poses strategic opportunities.  Players start the game by taking turns assembling sections of the Herakon Cluster, placing individual system tiles along with their own starting forces and the enemy objectives which they must defend.  This intentional construction, along with the unique Domination abilities of the game's four factions, means that Forbidden Stars will see players working to best utilize their own force's strengths while exploiting the weaknesses of their opponents.&#10;&#10;\"]"], ["thumbnail", "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2471359_t.jpg"], ["created_at", 2016-09-16 23:14:52 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-09-16 23:14:52 UTC]]

The cards can give you immediate bonuses, as well as increasing your production of different resources. Many cards also have requirements and they become playable when the temperature, oxygen, or ocean coverage increases enough.

While one victory condition is enough to claim the title of King, a game of experienced players usually has a tight balance of power, emphasizing the leadership of the capital of the island.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, players draft a hand of four action cards (with 13 action cards for three players and 17 for four players) during the Assembly. Action cards not played at the end of one season are not held for the next. Players also have access to leader cards for the territories that allow it and where they were elected leader during the assembly. Each Assembly reallocates those cards. Finally, they collect &quot;epic tales&quot; cards that depict the deeds of the ancient Irish gods and heroes, like Cuchulainn, the Dagda, Lugh and many others. These will be kept and used to inspire the clans and achieve extraordinary feats...under the right circumstances. The cards provide a variety of actions: adding clans, moving clans, building/exploring, and special actions.&#10;&#10;Careful drafting, hand management, bluffing (especially once players understand the importance of passing their turn), good timing, and a precise understanding of the balance of power are the keys to victory. After a discovery game you'll be ready for a full and epic game, where an undisputed will be king by the Assembly for his merit and wisdom.&#10;&#10;While Inis has &quot;dudes&quot; that are &quot;on a map&quot;, it's a beginner's mistake to play this as a battle game because eliminating other clans reduces your chances of scoring a Leadership victory condition. Peace among different clans, with or without a clear territory leader, is the usual outcome of a clan's movement. Battles will occur, of course, as the Celtic clans can be unruly and a good player will listen to his clan's people (i.e., his hand of cards). That battle aspect is reflected in the clan's miniatures representing warriors. Woodsmen, shepherds and traders complete the set of twelve minis for each player; these occupations have no impact on the game, but give it flavor.&#10;&#10;\"]"], ["thumbnail", "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3112623_t.jpg"], ["created_at", 2016-09-16 23:14:54 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-09-16 23:14:54 UTC]]

As civil war spreads throughout the galaxy, these leaders are invaluable to your efforts, and the secret missions they attempt will evoke many of the most inspiring moments from the classic trilogy.

It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player represents a character from one of five factions of Eastern Europa who are attempting to earn their fortune and claim their faction's stake in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.&#10;&#10;Each player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal.

Other than each player&rsquo;s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &ldquo;encounter&rdquo; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.&#10;&#10;Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns.

Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game.

However, your income is complemented with your production, and you also get VPs from many other sources.&#10;&#10;Each player keeps track of their production and resources on their player boards, and the game uses six types of resources: MegaCredits, Steel, Titanium, Plants, Energy, and Heat. On the game board, you compete for the best places for your city tiles, ocean tiles, and greenery tiles. You also compete for different Milestones and Awards worth many VPs. Each round is called a generation (guess why) and consists of the following phases:&#10;&#10;1) Player order shifts clockwise.&#10;2) Research phase: All players buy cards from four privately drawn.&#10;3) Action phase: Players take turns doing 1-2 actions from these options: Playing a card, claiming a Milestone, funding an Award, using a Standard project, converting plant into greenery tiles (and raising oxygen), converting heat into a temperature raise, and using the action of a card in play. The turn continues around the table until all players pass.&#10;4) Production phase: Players get resources according to their terraform rating and production parameters.&#10;&#10;When the three global parameters (temperature, oxygen, ocean) have all reached their goal, the terraforming is complete, and the game ends after that generation. Count your Terraform Rating and other VPs to determine the winning corporation!&#10;&#10;\"]"], ["thumbnail", "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2891964_t.jpg"], ["created_at", 2016-09-16 23:20:22 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-09-16 23:20:22 UTC]]

Players can try to achieve one of three different victory conditions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Leadership: Be the leader &mdash; i.e., have more clan figures than any other player &mdash; of territories containing at least six opponents' clans.&#10;     Land: Have your clans present in at least six different territories.&#10;     Religion: Have your clans present in territories that collectively contain at least six shrines.&#10;&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, players also earn deeds, typically chanted by bards or engraved by master crafters, that reduce by one the magic total of six for any condition. While one victory condition is enough to claim the title of King, a game of experienced players usually has a tight balance of power, emphasizing the leadership of the capital of the island.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, players draft a hand of four action cards (with 13 action cards for three players and 17 for four players) during the Assembly. Action cards not played at the end of one season are not held for the next. Players also have access to leader cards for the territories that allow it and where they were elected leader during the assembly. Each Assembly reallocates those cards. Finally, they collect &quot;epic tales&quot; cards that depict the deeds of the ancient Irish gods and heroes, like Cuchulainn, the Dagda, Lugh and many others. These will be kept and used to inspire the clans and achieve extraordinary feats...under the right circumstances. The cards provide a variety of actions: adding clans, moving clans, building/exploring, and special actions.&#10;&#10;Careful drafting, hand management, bluffing (especially once players understand the importance of passing their turn), good timing, and a precise understanding of the balance of power are the keys to victory. After a discovery game you'll be ready for a full and epic game, where an undisputed will be king by the Assembly for his merit and wisdom.&#10;&#10;While Inis has &quot;dudes&quot; that are &quot;on a map&quot;, it's a beginner's mistake to play this as a battle game because eliminating other clans reduces your chances of scoring a Leadership victory condition. Peace among different clans, with or without a clear territory leader, is the usual outcome of a clan's movement. Battles will occur, of course, as the Celtic clans can be unruly and a good player will listen to his clan's people (i.e., his hand of cards). That battle aspect is reflected in the clan's miniatures representing warriors. Woodsmen, shepherds and traders complete the set of twelve minis for each player; these occupations have no impact on the game, but give it flavor.&#10;&#10;\"]"], ["thumbnail", "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3112623_t.jpg"], ["created_at", 2016-09-16 23:20:23 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-09-16 23:20:23 UTC]]

The ashes from the first great war still darken the snow. The capitalistic city-state known simply as &ldquo;The Factory&rdquo;, which fueled the war with heavily armored mechs, has closed its doors, drawing the attention of several nearby countries.&#10;&#10;Scythe is a 4X board game set in an alternate-history 1920s period. It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player represents a character from one of five factions of Eastern Europa who are attempting to earn their fortune and claim their faction's stake in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.&#10;&#10;Each player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction&rsquo;s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place).&#10;&#10;Scythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player&rsquo;s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &ldquo;encounter&rdquo; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.&#10;&#10;Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.&#10;&#10;Every part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.&#10;&#10;\"]"], ["thumbnail", "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3163924_t.jpg"], ["created_at", 2016-09-16 23:22:11 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-09-16 23:22:11 UTC]]

The reward for successful domination surpasses all other concerns, and the price for conquering this sector will be paid in lives.&#10;&#10;Forbidden Stars challenges you and up to three other players to take command of a mighty fighting force: the Ultramarines chapter of Space Marines, the Eldar of Craftworld Iyanden, the Evil Sunz Ork clan, or the World Eaters Warband of the Chaos Space Marines. Each faction offers unique armies and play styles, but your goal remains the same &ndash; to claim the key objectives selected for your faction. These objective tokens are scattered throughout the Herakon Cluster, but your opponents are sure to defend your objectives against you. You need to build massive armies and command them in unending war to best your enemies and claim your objectives. The fight for the Herakon Cluster is brutal and bloody, and you will either stride triumphant over the bodies of your fallen foes, or they will do the same to you.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;Each round in Forbidden Stars is divided into three phases.  In the Planning Phase, players will take turns placing order tokens face down on the separate tiles (systems) that make up the game board.  The four types of order tokens that players may place during the Planning Phase correspond to four types of actions that players can resolve in the second phase of play, Operations.  In the Operations Phase, players can reveal a Dominate token to drain friendly planets of their important resources, a Strategize token to purchase cards which can upgrade their orders and combat abilities, a Deploy order which allows them to build cities, factories, bastions, and new mobile units, or an Advance order to move units and attack their enemies.  The last phase of each round is the Refresh Phase, where players profit off of the planets they control, reveal event cards to move the impassable Warp Storms, and heal any units that were wounded in battle.&#10;&#10;Because of the game's three-phase structure, strategy in Forbidden Stars is balanced between short-term bluffing and long-term tactical military action.  The game's setup also poses strategic opportunities.  Players start the game by taking turns assembling sections of the Herakon Cluster, placing individual system tiles along with their own starting forces and the enemy objectives which they must defend.  This intentional construction, along with the unique Domination abilities of the game's four factions, means that Forbidden Stars will see players working to best utilize their own force's strengths while exploiting the weaknesses of their opponents.&#10;&#10;\"]"], ["thumbnail", "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2471359_t.jpg"], ["created_at", 2016-09-16 23:22:11 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-09-16 23:22:11 UTC]]

The cards can give you immediate bonuses, as well as increasing your production of different resources. Many cards also have requirements and they become playable when the temperature, oxygen, or ocean coverage increases enough.

The ashes from the first great war still darken the snow. The capitalistic city-state known simply as &ldquo;The Factory&rdquo;, which fueled the war with heavily armored mechs, has closed its doors, drawing the attention of several nearby countries.&#10;&#10;Scythe is a 4X board game set in an alternate-history 1920s period. It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player represents a character from one of five factions of Eastern Europa who are attempting to earn their fortune and claim their faction's stake in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.&#10;&#10;Each player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction&rsquo;s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place).&#10;&#10;Scythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player&rsquo;s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &ldquo;encounter&rdquo; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.&#10;&#10;Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.&#10;&#10;Every part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.&#10;&#10;\"]"], ["thumbnail", "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3163924_t.jpg"], ["created_at", 2016-09-16 23:22:40 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-09-16 23:22:40 UTC]]

Now, the great factions of the galaxy mobilize their fleets and race to establish a foothold. The reward for successful domination surpasses all other concerns, and the price for conquering this sector will be paid in lives.&#10;&#10;Forbidden Stars challenges you and up to three other players to take command of a mighty fighting force: the Ultramarines chapter of Space Marines, the Eldar of Craftworld Iyanden, the Evil Sunz Ork clan, or the World Eaters Warband of the Chaos Space Marines. Each faction offers unique armies and play styles, but your goal remains the same &ndash; to claim the key objectives selected for your faction. These objective tokens are scattered throughout the Herakon Cluster, but your opponents are sure to defend your objectives against you. You need to build massive armies and command them in unending war to best your enemies and claim your objectives. The fight for the Herakon Cluster is brutal and bloody, and you will either stride triumphant over the bodies of your fallen foes, or they will do the same to you.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;Each round in Forbidden Stars is divided into three phases.  In the Planning Phase, players will take turns placing order tokens face down on the separate tiles (systems) that make up the game board.  The four types of order tokens that players may place during the Planning Phase correspond to four types of actions that players can resolve in the second phase of play, Operations.  In the Operations Phase, players can reveal a Dominate token to drain friendly planets of their important resources, a Strategize token to purchase cards which can upgrade their orders and combat abilities, a Deploy order which allows them to build cities, factories, bastions, and new mobile units, or an Advance order to move units and attack their enemies.  The last phase of each round is the Refresh Phase, where players profit off of the planets they control, reveal event cards to move the impassable Warp Storms, and heal any units that were wounded in battle.&#10;&#10;Because of the game's three-phase structure, strategy in Forbidden Stars is balanced between short-term bluffing and long-term tactical military action.  The game's setup also poses strategic opportunities.  Players start the game by taking turns assembling sections of the Herakon Cluster, placing individual system tiles along with their own starting forces and the enemy objectives which they must defend.  This intentional construction, along with the unique Domination abilities of the game's four factions, means that Forbidden Stars will see players working to best utilize their own force's strengths while exploiting the weaknesses of their opponents.&#10;&#10;\"]"], ["thumbnail", "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2471359_t.jpg"], ["created_at", 2016-09-16 23:22:40 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-09-16 23:22:40 UTC]]

The cards can give you immediate bonuses, as well as increasing your production of different resources. Many cards also have requirements and they become playable when the temperature, oxygen, or ocean coverage increases enough.

While one victory condition is enough to claim the title of King, a game of experienced players usually has a tight balance of power, emphasizing the leadership of the capital of the island.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, players draft a hand of four action cards (with 13 action cards for three players and 17 for four players) during the Assembly. Action cards not played at the end of one season are not held for the next. Players also have access to leader cards for the territories that allow it and where they were elected leader during the assembly. Each Assembly reallocates those cards. Finally, they collect &quot;epic tales&quot; cards that depict the deeds of the ancient Irish gods and heroes, like Cuchulainn, the Dagda, Lugh and many others. These will be kept and used to inspire the clans and achieve extraordinary feats...under the right circumstances. The cards provide a variety of actions: adding clans, moving clans, building/exploring, and special actions.&#10;&#10;Careful drafting, hand management, bluffing (especially once players understand the importance of passing their turn), good timing, and a precise understanding of the balance of power are the keys to victory. After a discovery game you'll be ready for a full and epic game, where an undisputed will be king by the Assembly for his merit and wisdom.&#10;&#10;While Inis has &quot;dudes&quot; that are &quot;on a map&quot;, it's a beginner's mistake to play this as a battle game because eliminating other clans reduces your chances of scoring a Leadership victory condition. Peace among different clans, with or without a clear territory leader, is the usual outcome of a clan's movement. Battles will occur, of course, as the Celtic clans can be unruly and a good player will listen to his clan's people (i.e., his hand of cards). That battle aspect is reflected in the clan's miniatures representing warriors. Woodsmen, shepherds and traders complete the set of twelve minis for each player; these occupations have no impact on the game, but give it flavor.&#10;&#10;\"]"], ["thumbnail", "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3112623_t.jpg"], ["created_at", 2016-09-16 23:22:42 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-09-16 23:22:42 UTC]]

Along the way, you can subjugate worlds or even destroy them.&#10;     As the Rebel player, you can command dozens of troopers, T-47 airspeeders, Corellian corvettes, and fighter squadrons. However, these forces are no match for the Imperial military. In terms of raw strength, you'll find yourself clearly overmatched from the very outset, so you'll need to rally the planets to join your cause and execute targeted military strikes to sabotage Imperial build yards and steal valuable intelligence.

As much as your success depends upon the strength of your starships, vehicles, and troops, it depends upon the individual efforts of such notable characters as Leia Organa, Mon Mothma, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Emperor Palpatine. As civil war spreads throughout the galaxy, these leaders are invaluable to your efforts, and the secret missions they attempt will evoke many of the most inspiring moments from the classic trilogy.

The ashes from the first great war still darken the snow. The capitalistic city-state known simply as &ldquo;The Factory&rdquo;, which fueled the war with heavily armored mechs, has closed its doors, drawing the attention of several nearby countries.&#10;&#10;Scythe is a 4X board game set in an alternate-history 1920s period. It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player represents a character from one of five factions of Eastern Europa who are attempting to earn their fortune and claim their faction's stake in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.&#10;&#10;Each player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction&rsquo;s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place).&#10;&#10;Scythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player&rsquo;s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &ldquo;encounter&rdquo; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.&#10;&#10;Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.&#10;&#10;Every part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.&#10;&#10;\"]"], ["thumbnail", "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3163924_t.jpg"], ["created_at", 2016-09-16 23:23:04 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-09-16 23:23:04 UTC]]

These objective tokens are scattered throughout the Herakon Cluster, but your opponents are sure to defend your objectives against you.

The fight for the Herakon Cluster is brutal and bloody, and you will either stride triumphant over the bodies of your fallen foes, or they will do the same to you.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;Each round in Forbidden Stars is divided into three phases.  In the Planning Phase, players will take turns placing order tokens face down on the separate tiles (systems) that make up the game board.  The four types of order tokens that players may place during the Planning Phase correspond to four types of actions that players can resolve in the second phase of play, Operations.  In the Operations Phase, players can reveal a Dominate token to drain friendly planets of their important resources, a Strategize token to purchase cards which can upgrade their orders and combat abilities, a Deploy order which allows them to build cities, factories, bastions, and new mobile units, or an Advance order to move units and attack their enemies.  The last phase of each round is the Refresh Phase, where players profit off of the planets they control, reveal event cards to move the impassable Warp Storms, and heal any units that were wounded in battle.&#10;&#10;Because of the game's three-phase structure, strategy in Forbidden Stars is balanced between short-term bluffing and long-term tactical military action.  The game's setup also poses strategic opportunities.  Players start the game by taking turns assembling sections of the Herakon Cluster, placing individual system tiles along with their own starting forces and the enemy objectives which they must defend.  This intentional construction, along with the unique Domination abilities of the game's four factions, means that Forbidden Stars will see players working to best utilize their own force's strengths while exploiting the weaknesses of their opponents.&#10;&#10;\"]"], ["thumbnail", "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2471359_t.jpg"], ["created_at", 2016-09-16 23:23:04 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-09-16 23:23:04 UTC]]

While one victory condition is enough to claim the title of King, a game of experienced players usually has a tight balance of power, emphasizing the leadership of the capital of the island.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, players draft a hand of four action cards (with 13 action cards for three players and 17 for four players) during the Assembly. Action cards not played at the end of one season are not held for the next. Players also have access to leader cards for the territories that allow it and where they were elected leader during the assembly. Each Assembly reallocates those cards. Finally, they collect &quot;epic tales&quot; cards that depict the deeds of the ancient Irish gods and heroes, like Cuchulainn, the Dagda, Lugh and many others. These will be kept and used to inspire the clans and achieve extraordinary feats...under the right circumstances. The cards provide a variety of actions: adding clans, moving clans, building/exploring, and special actions.&#10;&#10;Careful drafting, hand management, bluffing (especially once players understand the importance of passing their turn), good timing, and a precise understanding of the balance of power are the keys to victory. After a discovery game you'll be ready for a full and epic game, where an undisputed will be king by the Assembly for his merit and wisdom.&#10;&#10;While Inis has &quot;dudes&quot; that are &quot;on a map&quot;, it's a beginner's mistake to play this as a battle game because eliminating other clans reduces your chances of scoring a Leadership victory condition. Peace among different clans, with or without a clear territory leader, is the usual outcome of a clan's movement. Battles will occur, of course, as the Celtic clans can be unruly and a good player will listen to his clan's people (i.e., his hand of cards). That battle aspect is reflected in the clan's miniatures representing warriors. Woodsmen, shepherds and traders complete the set of twelve minis for each player; these occupations have no impact on the game, but give it flavor.&#10;&#10;\"]"], ["thumbnail", "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3112623_t.jpg"], ["created_at", 2016-09-16 23:23:06 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-09-16 23:23:06 UTC]]

It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player represents a character from one of five factions of Eastern Europa who are attempting to earn their fortune and claim their faction's stake in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.&#10;&#10;Each player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction&rsquo;s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place).&#10;&#10;Scythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player&rsquo;s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &ldquo;encounter&rdquo; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.&#10;&#10;Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.&#10;&#10;Every part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game.

The four types of order tokens that players may place during the Planning Phase correspond to four types of actions that players can resolve in the second phase of play, Operations.  In the Operations Phase, players can reveal a Dominate token to drain friendly planets of their important resources, a Strategize token to purchase cards which can upgrade their orders and combat abilities, a Deploy order which allows them to build cities, factories, bastions, and new mobile units, or an Advance order to move units and attack their enemies.  The last phase of each round is the Refresh Phase, where players profit off of the planets they control, reveal event cards to move the impassable Warp Storms, and heal any units that were wounded in battle.&#10;&#10;Because of the game's three-phase structure, strategy in Forbidden Stars is balanced between short-term bluffing and long-term tactical military action.  The game's setup also poses strategic opportunities.  Players start the game by taking turns assembling sections of the Herakon Cluster, placing individual system tiles along with their own starting forces and the enemy objectives which they must defend.  This intentional construction, along with the unique Domination abilities of the game's four factions, means that Forbidden Stars will see players working to best utilize their own force's strengths while exploiting the weaknesses of their opponents.&#10;&#10;\"]"], ["thumbnail", "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2471359_t.jpg"], ["created_at", 2016-09-16 23:23:22 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-09-16 23:23:22 UTC]]

The cards can give you immediate bonuses, as well as increasing your production of different resources. Many cards also have requirements and they become playable when the temperature, oxygen, or ocean coverage increases enough.

While one victory condition is enough to claim the title of King, a game of experienced players usually has a tight balance of power, emphasizing the leadership of the capital of the island.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, players draft a hand of four action cards (with 13 action cards for three players and 17 for four players) during the Assembly. Action cards not played at the end of one season are not held for the next. Players also have access to leader cards for the territories that allow it and where they were elected leader during the assembly. Each Assembly reallocates those cards. Finally, they collect &quot;epic tales&quot; cards that depict the deeds of the ancient Irish gods and heroes, like Cuchulainn, the Dagda, Lugh and many others.

The cards provide a variety of actions: adding clans, moving clans, building/exploring, and special actions.&#10;&#10;Careful drafting, hand management, bluffing (especially once players understand the importance of passing their turn), good timing, and a precise understanding of the balance of power are the keys to victory.

Peace among different clans, with or without a clear territory leader, is the usual outcome of a clan's movement. Battles will occur, of course, as the Celtic clans can be unruly and a good player will listen to his clan's people (i.e., his hand of cards). That battle aspect is reflected in the clan's miniatures representing warriors.

If you survive long enough and strengthen your reputation, you inspire the galaxy to a full-scale revolt, and you win.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Featuring more than 150 plastic miniatures and two game boards that account for thirty-two of the Star Wars galaxy's most notable systems, Rebellion features a scope that is as large and sweeping as any Star Wars game before it.&#10;&#10;Yet for all its grandiosity, Rebellion remains intensely personal, cinematic, and heroic. As much as your success depends upon the strength of your starships, vehicles, and troops, it depends upon the individual efforts of such notable characters as Leia Organa, Mon Mothma, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Emperor Palpatine. As civil war spreads throughout the galaxy, these leaders are invaluable to your efforts, and the secret missions they attempt will evoke many of the most inspiring moments from the classic trilogy. You might send Luke Skywalker to receive Jedi training on Dagobah or have Darth Vader spring a trap that freezes Han Solo in carbonite!&#10;&#10;\"]"], ["thumbnail", "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2737530_t.png"], ["created_at", 2016-09-16 23:23:24 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-09-16 23:23:24 UTC]]

It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player represents a character from one of five factions of Eastern Europa who are attempting to earn their fortune and claim their faction's stake in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.&#10;&#10;Each player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction&rsquo;s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place).&#10;&#10;Scythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player&rsquo;s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &ldquo;encounter&rdquo; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.&#10;&#10;Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.&#10;&#10;Every part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.&#10;&#10;\"]"], ["thumbnail", "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3163924_t.jpg"], ["created_at", 2016-09-16 23:23:46 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-09-16 23:23:46 UTC]]

These objective tokens are scattered throughout the Herakon Cluster, but your opponents are sure to defend your objectives against you.

The fight for the Herakon Cluster is brutal and bloody, and you will either stride triumphant over the bodies of your fallen foes, or they will do the same to you.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;Each round in Forbidden Stars is divided into three phases.  In the Planning Phase, players will take turns placing order tokens face down on the separate tiles (systems) that make up the game board.  The four types of order tokens that players may place during the Planning Phase correspond to four types of actions that players can resolve in the second phase of play, Operations.  In the Operations Phase, players can reveal a Dominate token to drain friendly planets of their important resources, a Strategize token to purchase cards which can upgrade their orders and combat abilities, a Deploy order which allows them to build cities, factories, bastions, and new mobile units, or an Advance order to move units and attack their enemies.  The last phase of each round is the Refresh Phase, where players profit off of the planets they control, reveal event cards to move the impassable Warp Storms, and heal any units that were wounded in battle.&#10;&#10;Because of the game's three-phase structure, strategy in Forbidden Stars is balanced between short-term bluffing and long-term tactical military action.  The game's setup also poses strategic opportunities.  Players start the game by taking turns assembling sections of the Herakon Cluster, placing individual system tiles along with their own starting forces and the enemy objectives which they must defend.  This intentional construction, along with the unique Domination abilities of the game's four factions, means that Forbidden Stars will see players working to best utilize their own force's strengths while exploiting the weaknesses of their opponents.&#10;&#10;\"]"], ["thumbnail", "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2471359_t.jpg"], ["created_at", 2016-09-16 23:23:46 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-09-16 23:23:46 UTC]]

The cards can give you immediate bonuses, as well as increasing your production of different resources.

Players can try to achieve one of three different victory conditions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Leadership: Be the leader &mdash; i.e., have more clan figures than any other player &mdash; of territories containing at least six opponents' clans.&#10;     Land: Have your clans present in at least six different territories.&#10;     Religion: Have your clans present in territories that collectively contain at least six shrines.&#10;&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, players also earn deeds, typically chanted by bards or engraved by master crafters, that reduce by one the magic total of six for any condition. While one victory condition is enough to claim the title of King, a game of experienced players usually has a tight balance of power, emphasizing the leadership of the capital of the island.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, players draft a hand of four action cards (with 13 action cards for three players and 17 for four players) during the Assembly. Action cards not played at the end of one season are not held for the next. Players also have access to leader cards for the territories that allow it and where they were elected leader during the assembly. Each Assembly reallocates those cards. Finally, they collect &quot;epic tales&quot; cards that depict the deeds of the ancient Irish gods and heroes, like Cuchulainn, the Dagda, Lugh and many others. These will be kept and used to inspire the clans and achieve extraordinary feats...under the right circumstances. The cards provide a variety of actions: adding clans, moving clans, building/exploring, and special actions.&#10;&#10;Careful drafting, hand management, bluffing (especially once players understand the importance of passing their turn), good timing, and a precise understanding of the balance of power are the keys to victory. After a discovery game you'll be ready for a full and epic game, where an undisputed will be king by the Assembly for his merit and wisdom.&#10;&#10;While Inis has &quot;dudes&quot; that are &quot;on a map&quot;, it's a beginner's mistake to play this as a battle game because eliminating other clans reduces your chances of scoring a Leadership victory condition. Peace among different clans, with or without a clear territory leader, is the usual outcome of a clan's movement. Battles will occur, of course, as the Celtic clans can be unruly and a good player will listen to his clan's people (i.e., his hand of cards). That battle aspect is reflected in the clan's miniatures representing warriors. Woodsmen, shepherds and traders complete the set of twelve minis for each player; these occupations have no impact on the game, but give it flavor.&#10;&#10;\"]"], ["thumbnail", "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3112623_t.jpg"], ["created_at", 2016-09-16 23:23:48 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-09-16 23:23:48 UTC]]

The ashes from the first great war still darken the snow. The capitalistic city-state known simply as &ldquo;The Factory&rdquo;, which fueled the war with heavily armored mechs, has closed its doors, drawing the attention of several nearby countries.&#10;&#10;Scythe is a 4X board game set in an alternate-history 1920s period. It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player represents a character from one of five factions of Eastern Europa who are attempting to earn their fortune and claim their faction's stake in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.&#10;&#10;Each player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction&rsquo;s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place).&#10;&#10;Scythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player&rsquo;s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &ldquo;encounter&rdquo; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.&#10;&#10;Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.&#10;&#10;Every part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.&#10;&#10;\"]"], ["thumbnail", "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3163924_t.jpg"], ["created_at", 2016-09-16 23:26:44 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-09-16 23:26:44 UTC]]

Now, the great factions of the galaxy mobilize their fleets and race to establish a foothold. The reward for successful domination surpasses all other concerns, and the price for conquering this sector will be paid in lives.&#10;&#10;Forbidden Stars challenges you and up to three other players to take command of a mighty fighting force: the Ultramarines chapter of Space Marines, the Eldar of Craftworld Iyanden, the Evil Sunz Ork clan, or the World Eaters Warband of the Chaos Space Marines. Each faction offers unique armies and play styles, but your goal remains the same &ndash; to claim the key objectives selected for your faction. These objective tokens are scattered throughout the Herakon Cluster, but your opponents are sure to defend your objectives against you. You need to build massive armies and command them in unending war to best your enemies and claim your objectives. The fight for the Herakon Cluster is brutal and bloody, and you will either stride triumphant over the bodies of your fallen foes, or they will do the same to you.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;Each round in Forbidden Stars is divided into three phases.  In the Planning Phase, players will take turns placing order tokens face down on the separate tiles (systems) that make up the game board.  The four types of order tokens that players may place during the Planning Phase correspond to four types of actions that players can resolve in the second phase of play, Operations.  In the Operations Phase, players can reveal a Dominate token to drain friendly planets of their important resources, a Strategize token to purchase cards which can upgrade their orders and combat abilities, a Deploy order which allows them to build cities, factories, bastions, and new mobile units, or an Advance order to move units and attack their enemies.  The last phase of each round is the Refresh Phase, where players profit off of the planets they control, reveal event cards to move the impassable Warp Storms, and heal any units that were wounded in battle.&#10;&#10;Because of the game's three-phase structure, strategy in Forbidden Stars is balanced between short-term bluffing and long-term tactical military action.  The game's setup also poses strategic opportunities.  Players start the game by taking turns assembling sections of the Herakon Cluster, placing individual system tiles along with their own starting forces and the enemy objectives which they must defend.  This intentional construction, along with the unique Domination abilities of the game's four factions, means that Forbidden Stars will see players working to best utilize their own force's strengths while exploiting the weaknesses of their opponents.&#10;&#10;\"]"], ["thumbnail", "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2471359_t.jpg"], ["created_at", 2016-09-16 23:26:45 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-09-16 23:26:45 UTC]]

The cards can give you immediate bonuses, as well as increasing your production of different resources. Many cards also have requirements and they become playable when the temperature, oxygen, or ocean coverage increases enough.

Standard Projects are always available to complement your cards.&#10;&#10;Your basic income, as well as your basic score, is based on your Terraform Rating (starting at 20), which increases every time you raise one of the three global parameters.

The turn continues around the table until all players pass.&#10;4) Production phase: Players get resources according to their terraform rating and production parameters.&#10;&#10;When the three global parameters (temperature, oxygen, ocean) have all reached their goal, the terraforming is complete, and the game ends after that generation.

Players can try to achieve one of three different victory conditions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Leadership: Be the leader &mdash; i.e., have more clan figures than any other player &mdash; of territories containing at least six opponents' clans.&#10;     Land: Have your clans present in at least six different territories.&#10;     Religion: Have your clans present in territories that collectively contain at least six shrines.&#10;&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, players also earn deeds, typically chanted by bards or engraved by master crafters, that reduce by one the magic total of six for any condition. While one victory condition is enough to claim the title of King, a game of experienced players usually has a tight balance of power, emphasizing the leadership of the capital of the island.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, players draft a hand of four action cards (with 13 action cards for three players and 17 for four players) during the Assembly. Action cards not played at the end of one season are not held for the next. Players also have access to leader cards for the territories that allow it and where they were elected leader during the assembly. Each Assembly reallocates those cards. Finally, they collect &quot;epic tales&quot; cards that depict the deeds of the ancient Irish gods and heroes, like Cuchulainn, the Dagda, Lugh and many others. These will be kept and used to inspire the clans and achieve extraordinary feats...under the right circumstances. The cards provide a variety of actions: adding clans, moving clans, building/exploring, and special actions.&#10;&#10;Careful drafting, hand management, bluffing (especially once players understand the importance of passing their turn), good timing, and a precise understanding of the balance of power are the keys to victory. After a discovery game you'll be ready for a full and epic game, where an undisputed will be king by the Assembly for his merit and wisdom.&#10;&#10;While Inis has &quot;dudes&quot; that are &quot;on a map&quot;, it's a beginner's mistake to play this as a battle game because eliminating other clans reduces your chances of scoring a Leadership victory condition. Peace among different clans, with or without a clear territory leader, is the usual outcome of a clan's movement. Battles will occur, of course, as the Celtic clans can be unruly and a good player will listen to his clan's people (i.e., his hand of cards). That battle aspect is reflected in the clan's miniatures representing warriors. Woodsmen, shepherds and traders complete the set of twelve minis for each player; these occupations have no impact on the game, but give it flavor.&#10;&#10;\"]"], ["thumbnail", "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3112623_t.jpg"], ["created_at", 2016-09-16 23:26:46 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-09-16 23:26:46 UTC]]

In Rebellion, you control the entire Galactic Empire or the fledgling Rebel Alliance. You must command starships, account for troop movements, and rally systems to your cause. Given the differences between the Empire and Rebel Alliance, each side has different win conditions, and you'll need to adjust your play style depending on who you represent:&#10;&#10;     As the Imperial player, you can command legions of Stormtroopers, swarms of TIEs, Star Destroyers, and even the Death Star. You rule the galaxy by fear, relying on the power of your massive military to enforce your will. To win the game, you need to snuff out the budding Rebel Alliance by finding its base and obliterating it. Along the way, you can subjugate worlds or even destroy them.&#10;     As the Rebel player, you can command dozens of troopers, T-47 airspeeders, Corellian corvettes, and fighter squadrons. However, these forces are no match for the Imperial military. In terms of raw strength, you'll find yourself clearly overmatched from the very outset, so you'll need to rally the planets to join your cause and execute targeted military strikes to sabotage Imperial build yards and steal valuable intelligence. To win the Galactic Civil War, you'll need to sway the galaxy's citizens to your cause. If you survive long enough and strengthen your reputation, you inspire the galaxy to a full-scale revolt, and you win.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Featuring more than 150 plastic miniatures and two game boards that account for thirty-two of the Star Wars galaxy's most notable systems, Rebellion features a scope that is as large and sweeping as any Star Wars game before it.&#10;&#10;Yet for all its grandiosity, Rebellion remains intensely personal, cinematic, and heroic. As much as your success depends upon the strength of your starships, vehicles, and troops, it depends upon the individual efforts of such notable characters as Leia Organa, Mon Mothma, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Emperor Palpatine. As civil war spreads throughout the galaxy, these leaders are invaluable to your efforts, and the secret missions they attempt will evoke many of the most inspiring moments from the classic trilogy.

The ashes from the first great war still darken the snow. The capitalistic city-state known simply as &ldquo;The Factory&rdquo;, which fueled the war with heavily armored mechs, has closed its doors, drawing the attention of several nearby countries.&#10;&#10;Scythe is a 4X board game set in an alternate-history 1920s period. It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player represents a character from one of five factions of Eastern Europa who are attempting to earn their fortune and claim their faction's stake in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.&#10;&#10;Each player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction&rsquo;s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place).&#10;&#10;Scythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player&rsquo;s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &ldquo;encounter&rdquo; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.&#10;&#10;Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.&#10;&#10;Every part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.&#10;&#10;\"]"], ["thumbnail", "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3163924_t.jpg"], ["created_at", 2016-09-16 23:29:52 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-09-16 23:29:52 UTC]]

The fight for the Herakon Cluster is brutal and bloody, and you will either stride triumphant over the bodies of your fallen foes, or they will do the same to you.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;Each round in Forbidden Stars is divided into three phases.  In the Planning Phase, players will take turns placing order tokens face down on the separate tiles (systems) that make up the game board.  The four types of order tokens that players may place during the Planning Phase correspond to four types of actions that players can resolve in the second phase of play, Operations.  In the Operations Phase, players can reveal a Dominate token to drain friendly planets of their important resources, a Strategize token to purchase cards which can upgrade their orders and combat abilities, a Deploy order which allows them to build cities, factories, bastions, and new mobile units, or an Advance order to move units and attack their enemies.  The last phase of each round is the Refresh Phase, where players profit off of the planets they control, reveal event cards to move the impassable Warp Storms, and heal any units that were wounded in battle.&#10;&#10;Because of the game's three-phase structure, strategy in Forbidden Stars is balanced between short-term bluffing and long-term tactical military action.  The game's setup also poses strategic opportunities.  Players start the game by taking turns assembling sections of the Herakon Cluster, placing individual system tiles along with their own starting forces and the enemy objectives which they must defend.  This intentional construction, along with the unique Domination abilities of the game's four factions, means that Forbidden Stars will see players working to best utilize their own force's strengths while exploiting the weaknesses of their opponents.&#10;&#10;\"]"], ["thumbnail", "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2471359_t.jpg"], ["created_at", 2016-09-16 23:29:52 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-09-16 23:29:52 UTC]]

The cards can give you immediate bonuses, as well as increasing your production of different resources. Many cards also have requirements and they become playable when the temperature, oxygen, or ocean coverage increases enough.

The turn continues around the table until all players pass.&#10;4) Production phase: Players get resources according to their terraform rating and production parameters.&#10;&#10;When the three global parameters (temperature, oxygen, ocean) have all reached their goal, the terraforming is complete, and the game ends after that generation.

While one victory condition is enough to claim the title of King, a game of experienced players usually has a tight balance of power, emphasizing the leadership of the capital of the island.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, players draft a hand of four action cards (with 13 action cards for three players and 17 for four players) during the Assembly. Action cards not played at the end of one season are not held for the next. Players also have access to leader cards for the territories that allow it and where they were elected leader during the assembly. Each Assembly reallocates those cards. Finally, they collect &quot;epic tales&quot; cards that depict the deeds of the ancient Irish gods and heroes, like Cuchulainn, the Dagda, Lugh and many others. These will be kept and used to inspire the clans and achieve extraordinary feats...under the right circumstances. The cards provide a variety of actions: adding clans, moving clans, building/exploring, and special actions.&#10;&#10;Careful drafting, hand management, bluffing (especially once players understand the importance of passing their turn), good timing, and a precise understanding of the balance of power are the keys to victory.

Peace among different clans, with or without a clear territory leader, is the usual outcome of a clan's movement. Battles will occur, of course, as the Celtic clans can be unruly and a good player will listen to his clan's people (i.e., his hand of cards). That battle aspect is reflected in the clan's miniatures representing warriors.

If you survive long enough and strengthen your reputation, you inspire the galaxy to a full-scale revolt, and you win.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Featuring more than 150 plastic miniatures and two game boards that account for thirty-two of the Star Wars galaxy's most notable systems, Rebellion features a scope that is as large and sweeping as any Star Wars game before it.&#10;&#10;Yet for all its grandiosity, Rebellion remains intensely personal, cinematic, and heroic. As much as your success depends upon the strength of your starships, vehicles, and troops, it depends upon the individual efforts of such notable characters as Leia Organa, Mon Mothma, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Emperor Palpatine. As civil war spreads throughout the galaxy, these leaders are invaluable to your efforts, and the secret missions they attempt will evoke many of the most inspiring moments from the classic trilogy. You might send Luke Skywalker to receive Jedi training on Dagobah or have Darth Vader spring a trap that freezes Han Solo in carbonite!&#10;&#10;\"]"], ["thumbnail", "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2737530_t.png"], ["created_at", 2016-09-16 23:29:54 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-09-16 23:29:54 UTC]]

The ashes from the first great war still darken the snow. The capitalistic city-state known simply as &ldquo;The Factory&rdquo;, which fueled the war with heavily armored mechs, has closed its doors, drawing the attention of several nearby countries.&#10;&#10;Scythe is a 4X board game set in an alternate-history 1920s period. It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player represents a character from one of five factions of Eastern Europa who are attempting to earn their fortune and claim their faction's stake in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.&#10;&#10;Each player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction&rsquo;s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place).&#10;&#10;Scythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player&rsquo;s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &ldquo;encounter&rdquo; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.&#10;&#10;Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.&#10;&#10;Every part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.&#10;&#10;\"]"], ["thumbnail", "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3163924_t.jpg"], ["created_at", 2016-09-16 23:33:44 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-09-16 23:33:44 UTC]]

Now, the great factions of the galaxy mobilize their fleets and race to establish a foothold. The reward for successful domination surpasses all other concerns, and the price for conquering this sector will be paid in lives.&#10;&#10;Forbidden Stars challenges you and up to three other players to take command of a mighty fighting force: the Ultramarines chapter of Space Marines, the Eldar of Craftworld Iyanden, the Evil Sunz Ork clan, or the World Eaters Warband of the Chaos Space Marines. Each faction offers unique armies and play styles, but your goal remains the same &ndash; to claim the key objectives selected for your faction. These objective tokens are scattered throughout the Herakon Cluster, but your opponents are sure to defend your objectives against you. You need to build massive armies and command them in unending war to best your enemies and claim your objectives. The fight for the Herakon Cluster is brutal and bloody, and you will either stride triumphant over the bodies of your fallen foes, or they will do the same to you.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;Each round in Forbidden Stars is divided into three phases.  In the Planning Phase, players will take turns placing order tokens face down on the separate tiles (systems) that make up the game board.  The four types of order tokens that players may place during the Planning Phase correspond to four types of actions that players can resolve in the second phase of play, Operations.  In the Operations Phase, players can reveal a Dominate token to drain friendly planets of their important resources, a Strategize token to purchase cards which can upgrade their orders and combat abilities, a Deploy order which allows them to build cities, factories, bastions, and new mobile units, or an Advance order to move units and attack their enemies.  The last phase of each round is the Refresh Phase, where players profit off of the planets they control, reveal event cards to move the impassable Warp Storms, and heal any units that were wounded in battle.&#10;&#10;Because of the game's three-phase structure, strategy in Forbidden Stars is balanced between short-term bluffing and long-term tactical military action.  The game's setup also poses strategic opportunities.  Players start the game by taking turns assembling sections of the Herakon Cluster, placing individual system tiles along with their own starting forces and the enemy objectives which they must defend.  This intentional construction, along with the unique Domination abilities of the game's four factions, means that Forbidden Stars will see players working to best utilize their own force's strengths while exploiting the weaknesses of their opponents.&#10;&#10;\"]"], ["thumbnail", "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2471359_t.jpg"], ["created_at", 2016-09-16 23:33:44 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-09-16 23:33:44 UTC]]

The projects (cards) can represent anything from introducing plant life or animals, hurling asteroids at the surface, building cities, to mining the moons of Jupiter and establishing greenhouse gas industries to heat up the atmosphere. The cards can give you immediate bonuses, as well as increasing your production of different resources. Many cards also have requirements and they become playable when the temperature, oxygen, or ocean coverage increases enough. Buying cards is costly, so there is a balance between buying cards (3 megacredits per card) and actually playing them (which can cost anything between 0 to 41 megacredits, depending on the project). Standard Projects are always available to complement your cards.&#10;&#10;Your basic income, as well as your basic score, is based on your Terraform Rating (starting at 20), which increases every time you raise one of the three global parameters. However, your income is complemented with your production, and you also get VPs from many other sources.&#10;&#10;Each player keeps track of their production and resources on their player boards, and the game uses six types of resources: MegaCredits, Steel, Titanium, Plants, Energy, and Heat. On the game board, you compete for the best places for your city tiles, ocean tiles, and greenery tiles. You also compete for different Milestones and Awards worth many VPs. Each round is called a generation (guess why) and consists of the following phases:&#10;&#10;1) Player order shifts clockwise.&#10;2) Research phase: All players buy cards from four privately drawn.&#10;3) Action phase: Players take turns doing 1-2 actions from these options: Playing a card, claiming a Milestone, funding an Award, using a Standard project, converting plant into greenery tiles (and raising oxygen), converting heat into a temperature raise, and using the action of a card in play. The turn continues around the table until all players pass.&#10;4) Production phase: Players get resources according to their terraform rating and production parameters.&#10;&#10;When the three global parameters (temperature, oxygen, ocean) have all reached their goal, the terraforming is complete, and the game ends after that generation.

Players can try to achieve one of three different victory conditions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Leadership: Be the leader &mdash; i.e., have more clan figures than any other player &mdash; of territories containing at least six opponents' clans.&#10;     Land: Have your clans present in at least six different territories.&#10;     Religion: Have your clans present in territories that collectively contain at least six shrines.&#10;&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, players also earn deeds, typically chanted by bards or engraved by master crafters, that reduce by one the magic total of six for any condition. While one victory condition is enough to claim the title of King, a game of experienced players usually has a tight balance of power, emphasizing the leadership of the capital of the island.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, players draft a hand of four action cards (with 13 action cards for three players and 17 for four players) during the Assembly. Action cards not played at the end of one season are not held for the next. Players also have access to leader cards for the territories that allow it and where they were elected leader during the assembly. Each Assembly reallocates those cards. Finally, they collect &quot;epic tales&quot; cards that depict the deeds of the ancient Irish gods and heroes, like Cuchulainn, the Dagda, Lugh and many others. These will be kept and used to inspire the clans and achieve extraordinary feats...under the right circumstances. The cards provide a variety of actions: adding clans, moving clans, building/exploring, and special actions.&#10;&#10;Careful drafting, hand management, bluffing (especially once players understand the importance of passing their turn), good timing, and a precise understanding of the balance of power are the keys to victory. After a discovery game you'll be ready for a full and epic game, where an undisputed will be king by the Assembly for his merit and wisdom.&#10;&#10;While Inis has &quot;dudes&quot; that are &quot;on a map&quot;, it's a beginner's mistake to play this as a battle game because eliminating other clans reduces your chances of scoring a Leadership victory condition. Peace among different clans, with or without a clear territory leader, is the usual outcome of a clan's movement. Battles will occur, of course, as the Celtic clans can be unruly and a good player will listen to his clan's people (i.e., his hand of cards). That battle aspect is reflected in the clan's miniatures representing warriors. Woodsmen, shepherds and traders complete the set of twelve minis for each player; these occupations have no impact on the game, but give it flavor.&#10;&#10;\"]"], ["thumbnail", "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3112623_t.jpg"], ["created_at", 2016-09-16 23:33:46 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-09-16 23:33:46 UTC]]
